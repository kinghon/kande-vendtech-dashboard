If you got $10,000 saved up and you're
trying to figure out what to do with it,
this is the video for you. I spent 14
years in real estate, fixing and
flipping properties and building rental
portfolios for higher net worth
individuals. And two years ago, I put
everything I had and I went all in on
vending machines. Today, I'm going to
talk about when you invest $10,000 into
three different vehicles: index funds,
rental real estate, and vending [music]
machines. We're going to look at all the
returns, the risks, the time commitment,
and what the money looks like after 5 to
10 years. Now, I have to be upfront.
These are estimates on historical
averages and what I've personally seen
firsthand. [music] This isn't financial
advice, but what I can tell you is what
the math looks like behind real numbers.
And by the end of this video, you're
going to understand why I stopped
chasing real estate deals and went all
in on vending. Let's break it down.
Okay, let's start with what most people
consider the safe option, putting your
money in an index fund. Here's the
traditional wisdom. Put your money in an
S&P index fund, leave it alone, and let
it compound interest and let it do its
thing. Retire in 30 or 40 years. And
look, there's nothing wrong with this
approach. It's simple. It's passive. And
historically, it works well over a long
period of time. Let's look at the actual
numbers. The S&P 500 has returned
historically a 10% average every single
year. That's before inflation. After
inflation, you're looking at more like
7%. But let's be generous and just let's
use the 10%. So, this is what $10,000
actually looks like in the fund. Year 1,
$11,000 total. Year two, $12,100.
Year three, $13,300.
Year four, $14,641.
After 5 years of just a 10% average
annual return, your 10,000 has roughly
turned into $16,000. You made about
$6,000 in gains. And after 10 years,
you're roughly like around $26,000. You
made about $16,000 in gains. Now, here's
the thing about the index funds. That
10% is an average. Some years you're up
20, some years you're down 30. In the
year 2022, the S&P almost dropped down
to like around 20%. And in 2008, it
dropped down 40%. And if you need that
money during a down year, you're selling
at a loss or you're waiting years for it
to recover. The other reality that
$6,000 gain over 5 years, you can't
touch it without resetting the clock.
Can't use it to pay your bills. It's
locked up if you want to keep it
compounding. And 16,000 after 10 years
is nice. It's not life-changing money,
and it's definitely not quitting your
job money. Don't get me wrong, index
funds have a place in a portfolio. I'm
not saying don't invest in the market.
If you're looking for something to
replace your income and build cash flow
for you now, $10,000 in an index fund
isn't going to get you there. All right,
now let's talk about real estate. This
is where I've had a lot of firsthand
experience. I was in real estate for 14
years. From 2009 to 2016, I owned a
consulting firm. We did fix and flips
and I consulted on building rental
portfolios for higher net worth
individuals. From 2016 to 2023, I was
head of business development for a real
estate boutique firm. [music] I've seen
the good, the bad, and the ugly of real
estate investing. So, let's look at what
$10,000 actually gets you in real
estate. Here's the first problem.
$10,000 isn't even enough. The average
down payment for a rental property is on
average anywhere from 20 to 25%. Even on
a $200,000 property, that's $40 to
$60,000 just for the down payment. Then
you got closing cost, another 2 to 5% of
the purchase price, another 4 to$10,000.
So, right out the gate, $10,000 doesn't
even get you in the door. You're $30 to
$50,000 short. But let's say you find a
cheap property. Maybe you find something
for 100 grand. 20% down is still
$20,000. You're still 10K short. Let's
just imagine that you figure out a way
to make it work. You find a [music]
property. You scrape together the down
payment. Close on your first rental. Now
the real fun begins. You got a mortgage
payment every month. Whether you have a
tenant or not, you have property taxes,
insurance, maintenance, and repairs,
property management fees. If you don't
want to deal with the tenants [music]
yourself, that is. And here's what
nobody talks about. Tenants don't always
pay rent on time. I've seen landlords go
months without collecting and evictions
can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months
depending on the state. [music] Things
break, furnace goes out in January,
that's 5K. The roof needs repair, that's
10,000. That pipe burst, there goes your
cash flow for the year. Vacancies
happen. Average vacancy rates anywhere
from 5 to 10%. That's a half a month to
a full month of no income every single
year. Let's look at realistic cash flow.
On $100,000 rental property after
mortgage, taxes, insurance, and
vacancies, it might cash for anywhere
from like 2 to300 bucks a month. If
everything goes well, that's anywhere
from $2,400 to $3,600 a year. And a
$20,000 investment, talking about
anywhere from 12 to 18% cash on cash
return in a good year. But here's the
risk. One bad tenant wipes that whole
year of cash flow away. One major repair
wipes away 2 years and you're personally
liable for that mortgage if that
property performs or not. After 5 years
in real estate with no major issues,
you've made maybe 15 to 20k in cash
flow. You built some equity and you've
paid down the principal on your
mortgage. But you also dealt with
headaches, stress, and high [music]
risks. Worst case scenario, you have
problem tenants, major repairs or
vacancies. You barely broke even, or
worse, you lost money. This is why I got
out of real estate. The returns were
unpredictable, the headaches were
consistent, and the barrier to entry was
massive. $10,000 doesn't even get you
started. And even when you're in, one
bad year can wipe out everything. All
right, let's talk about if you put that
same $10,000 into vending machines.
Unlike real estate, $10,000 is more than
enough to get started. Let's say you use
that $10,000 strategically. You finance
your first machine with 5 to 10% down.
The payment of the machine is like
around $150. The cost of goods to fill
up the machine in the first time is
anywhere from $600 to 900 bucks. You
keep the rest as operational capital.
With $10,000, you realistically could
start with two to three machines and
still have enough cash reserve for
inventory and unexpected expenses. Now,
let's look at the returns. A wellplaced
vending machine will do anywhere from
$1,500 to $3,000 a month at the
location. Let's be conservative and
let's just say $2,000 a month. Your cost
of goods is anywhere from 35 to 40%.
Your credit card processing and software
fees are another 10%. So you're looking
at anywhere from 50 to 55% gross margins
on $2,000 revenue. That's $1,000 to
$1,100 gross profit. Minus your machine
payment of like 150 bucks minus your
soccer labor from anywhere from 100 to
150. You're netting around $680 to $830
per month per machine. Let's do the math
on $10,000 invested. Let's start with
two machines where you're profiting $800
a month each. That's $69 per month per
profit. That's $19,200 per year. Your
$10,000 investment is returning over
200% in year one. But here's where it
gets interesting. You reinvest. You take
those profits and you add more
locations. By month six, you add
location number three. By month 12, you
add locations number four and five. Now
you're at five machines doing 800 bucks
each. That's $4,000 a month, $48,000 per
year. After 5 years of consistent
reinvestment, if you keep adding
locations and scaling efficiently, you
could be [music] realistically at
anywhere from 15 to 20 locations. You
could be doing anywhere from 12 to
$16,000 a month in profit. That's
$144,000 to $192,000 per year from a
$10,000 starting investment. Compare
that to your other options. Index funds
after 5 years is $16,000 total and only
$6,000 in gain. And in real estate,
after 5 years, you're anywhere from $5
to $20,000 a year in cash flow. And
that's if everything goes perfect.
Vending after 5 years, potentially
$150,000 plus per year in passive
ongoing cash flow. And here's the
kicker, those vending machines are also
assets. They keep producing income month
after month. And vending machines sell
anywhere from 1 to 1.5x of revenue. So
your 15 to 20 location vending operation
doing $150,000 per year. Your vending
route now is worth anywhere from
$360,000 to $540,000 if you ever want to
go ahead and sell. Now let's talk about
something that people don't consider
enough. Risk adjusted returns. It's not
about how much money you can make. It's
about how likely you are to actually
make it. And that happens when things go
wrong. Index funds risks, market
volatility, you have zero control. Can
drop 20 to 40% in a bad year. Timeline
risks. You need the money during a down
year. Inflation eats into your real
returns. But the upside, truly passive,
no work required, diversified across
hundreds of companies. Now for the real
estate risks. High barrier to entry, 40
to 50k minimum, tenant risk,
non-payment, evictions, and property
damage. Maintenance risks. One major
repair wipes out one year of profit.
Market risks. Property values can drop.
Liquidity risks. Can't sell quickly if
you need the cash. Personal liability.
You're on the hook for that mortgage.
And the time commitment, finding deals,
managing tenants, or finding a property
manager. Handling repairs and
maintenance. And it's not passive unless
you pay somebody else to do it. Vending
risks. Location underperforms, but you
can move the machine, right, Colin?
>> Yeah,
>> we just did it. Machine breaks. They're
under warranty if you buy new.
Vandalism, insurance covers it. Here's
what I've learned. If the location isn't
working after 90 days, I pull the
machine and relocate it to another
location. That's not possible with a
rental property. Just can't pick it up
and move it over to a better
neighborhood. The failure rate
differences in vending. If you follow
the system, pick high foot traffic
locations, match the machines to the
demographic, stock what sells, provide
good service, it's very, very hard to
fail cuz you're providing something to
people that they actually need. People
always need snacks and drinks. It's not
dependent on market conditions or
interest rates. the time of
profitability. Index funds take decades
to build meaningful wealth. Real estate
takes years to build cash flow and
that's assuming even if you could get
started. Vending your first machine can
be profitable in 30 or 60 days. Let's
talk about what nobody wants to admit.
The time of these investments of what
they actually require. Index funds truly
passive. Set up an automatic investment.
Check it once a quarter. Maybe rebalance
it once a year. Total time few hours per
year. This is one advantage that index
funds has. They almost require zero
time. Real estate not passive at all.
finding deals, hours of research,
property visits, and negotiations,
closings, weeks of paperwork,
inspections, back and forth, managing,
[music]
tenant calls, maintenance, coordination,
and rent collection. Even with a
property manager, you're still involved
in big decisions. I've seen people spend
anywhere from 10 to 20 hours a month on
a single rental property, and that's
when things are going well. Vending
passive once you build your systems. In
the beginning, [music] yes, it
absolutely takes work, finding
locations, learning the business, maybe
stocking machines yourself. But here's
the difference. You'd hire a stalker for
20 to 25 bucks an hour. One stalker can
handle 10 to 15 locations. You build
systems and remove yourself from the
day-to-day. I work 8 to 10 hours a week
on my 45 location operation. That's
before I hired Colin. Now I only work
like what Colin it's like 30 minutes a
day. We check in 5 days a week. So like
I don't know 3 hours, 2 hours. Most of
that is strategic looking at numbers and
planning growth. I'm not stocking
machines. I'm not putting out fires.
It's [ __ ] Colin's job now.
>> Yeah. [laughter]
the path to passive. Month 1 through
six, you're learning and doing the work
yourself. Month 6 through 12, you hire
your first stalker and you start
removing yourself from the day-to-day
operations. Month 12 plus, you're
working on the business and you're not
working in it. Real estate never gets
there unless you pay a property manager
8 to 10% to get there. And even then,
you're still dealing with the big
issues. All right, let's zoom out and
let's take a look at what these
investments can do after 10 years.
Again, these averages are based on
historical figures and everything that
what I've seen. Your results will vary
and this is not financial advice.
$10,000 in index funds after 10 years at
a 10% annualized return. You're at
roughly $26,000. You gained about
$16,000. Still not enough to change your
life. Still not producing cash flow.
Still depending on selling to access
those gains. $10,000 in real estate
after 10 years, assuming that you could
ever get started with just $10,000. And
assuming everything goes well, maybe
you've built 50 to 100K in equity in
appreciation. Maybe you made 30 to
$40,000 in cumulative cash flow, but you
also dealt with tenant turnover, repairs
and maintenance, stress and time
commitment, and you're still dependent
on one property performing $10,000 in
vending after 10 years. If you reinvest
profits and keep scaling, you could
realistically build a 30 to 50 location
operation doing anywhere from $25,000 to
$40,000 a month in profit. That's
anywhere from 300 to $480,000 per year.
And here's the thing, that operation is
an asset. Routes sell for one to one
half acts of revenue. $1 million revenue
operation could sell for $1 million. The
wealth building differences. Index
funds, you turn 10K into 26K. Nice, but
not life-changing. Real estate, you
built $100,000 on equity. Better, but it
took forever and it took a lot of work.
Vending, you've potentially built a
business from anywhere from $500,000 to
a million dollar plus. That's producing
$300,000 per year in cash flow. That's
the difference between saving for
retirement and building generational
wealth. I've done real estate. I've done
the corporate thing. And I've done
vending. Nothing has given me the
returns, the freedom, and the peace of
mind like vending has. If you want to
