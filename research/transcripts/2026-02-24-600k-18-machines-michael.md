## Key Takeaways

### Revenue & Scale
- 18 machines, ~$650K/year gross revenue in ~20 months
- On track to hit $1M annual revenue by April 2026
- 15-20 unsigned contracts in pipeline at any time
- One Stockwell location doing **$70,000/year** from a single machine

### Strategy: Efficiency Over Volume
- Selective about locations — high-value only
- Fewer locations = lower employee costs, insurance, van costs, logistics
- "As opposed to having 10 locations doing $500 each" — focus on quality
- Upgraded $70K location from Stockwell to PicoV Plus + ambient

### Sales Cycle
- **6-8 months** from first handshake to signed contract
- **30 pop-ins per week** during growth phase
- "Vending is the last thing on these people's minds" — property managers have toilets bursting, rent issues, domestics, reports
- Contracts come in bunches — "floodgates open" after persistent follow-up
- First location took ~6 weeks from initial pop-in to signed contract

### Location Intelligence
- Best location: right by mailroom + main elevator + parking garage entrance
- Stocking 3-4x/week at highest volume locations (reduced to ~2.5x after upgrading to larger PicoV)
- Never leave any row empty — restock philosophy

### Product Insights
- **Smart Water at $4 outsells Aquafina** — branding > price for water
- Pure Life at $1.99, Smart Water at $4.99 — both sell well
- Voss and San Pellegrino as carbonated water options do "phenomenal"
- Water margins are incredible — "unbelievable" profit on water
- South Bend Chocolate dark salty chocolate pretzels — high throughput
- Even tried selling old-fashioned cocktail kits ($35/pop) — niche but worked

### Business Model
- Family business with stepson (business degree from A&M)
- Stepson worked part-time at Lowe's while building the route
- Michael didn't take pay for first ~17 months — all went to growth
- Now both getting regular monthly salary + savings
- Working on official partnership paperwork

### Background
- Based in Houston area (mentions Chicago weather)
- Former blue-collar worker, Air Force vet, no college
- Previously did crypto mining — volatile, switched to vending for stability
- Self-employed since 2013
