### /usage ✅ (with 1 minor issue noted)
- Stats correct: 152 turns today, 376 avg/day, 3,005 7-day total, $109.44 est. cost
- Breakdown table correct: Cron Jobs (152 today, 1,913 7-day), Jumpgate (0 today, 55 7-day)
- **Minor:** Line chart appears blank despite data loading correctly
  - Root cause: Data IS present (66 active slots, 244 peak). Chart.js CDN loads latest version — possible breaking change with sparse data rendering or the thin lines are not visible at the zoom level in screenshots.
  - Stats and table are correct; cosmetic chart issue only

## Bug Report

### 🟡 Minor: /usage line chart not rendering visible lines
- **Severity:** Cosmetic — all data stats are correct
- **Observed:** Chart canvas shows axes and legend but no colored lines
- **Data confirmed:** API returns 75 slots for Cron Jobs (Feb 22–Mar 1), stats compute correctly
- **Possible causes:**
  1. `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js` (no version pin) may have loaded a breaking version
  2. Lines may be rendering at y≈0 on most slots (sparse data) and thin spikes aren't visible at screenshot scale
- **Recommended fix:** Pin Chart.js to a specific version (e.g. `chart.js@4.4.0`) and test

### ℹ️ Note: /dashboard returns 404
- `GET /dashboard/` → "Cannot GET /dashboard/"
- Root cause: Express static middleware redirects `/dashboard` → `/dashboard/` (directory exists) but no `index.html` in that directory
- **Not user-facing** — no nav links point to `/dashboard`; the actual home is `/home` which works fine
- Low priority; safe to ignore unless a feature links to `/dashboard`
