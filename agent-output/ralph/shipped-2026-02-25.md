# Ralph Overnight Report — Feb 25, 2026

**Mission:** QA sweep (no pending backlog tasks)
**Time:** 8:00 PM – 8:10 PM PST

---

## Summary

Backlog was clear. Ran full QA sweep across all vend.kandedash.com pages and APIs.
Found and fixed one real bug: broken endpoint reference in two monitoring pages.

---

## QA Results

### Pages (40 checked)
- **38/40 passing 200** ✅
- `/dashboard.html` → 404 (file doesn't exist, not linked anywhere — not a bug)
- `/leads.html` → 404 (file doesn't exist, not linked anywhere — not a bug)

### Nav Routes (38 checked)
- **38/38 passing 200** ✅ — all nav routes healthy

### APIs
| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/health` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/auth/status` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/prospects` | ✅ 200 | 529 total pipeline cards |
| `/api/activities` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/pipeline/stats` | ✅ 200 | 447 new leads, 3 active clients |
| `/api/team/status` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/team/learnings` | ✅ 200 | relay has learnings |
| `/api/briefing` | ✅ 200 | 6 new prospects, 13 follow-ups |
| `/api/cron/schedule` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/memory/db-list` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/usage/turns` | ✅ 200 | |
| `/api/memory/list` | ⚠️ 500 | Hardcoded Mac path (Railway can't read). Not used by any page — memory.html uses db-list. Low priority. |

## Bug Fixed

**`/api/cron/status` → `/api/cron/schedule` in monitoring pages**

Both `api-monitoring.html` and `pb-monitoring.html` were calling `/api/cron/status`,
which doesn't exist (server only has `/api/cron/schedule`). This caused the "Cron Status"
check on the API Health Monitor to always show as a critical failure (404).

**Fix:** Updated both files to use `/api/cron/schedule` which has the same response shape (`data.jobs[]`).

**Result:**
- Before: 8 Healthy, 1 Warning (Cron Status critical failure)
- After: **9 Healthy, 0 Warnings, 0 Errors** ✅

**Commit:** `a78b6f2` — `[ralph] fix: /api/cron/status → /api/cron/schedule in monitoring pages`
**Pushed:** Yes, live on Railway

## Screenshots

### API Health Monitor — After Fix
`/Users/kurtishon/.openclaw/media/browser/cad4f34f-0313-403d-8e7d-9cda5bbfdc33.jpg`

- All 9 endpoints green ✅
- Cron Status card now shows `GET /api/cron/schedule` — 200 OK

### PB Monitoring — After Fix
`/Users/kurtishon/.openclaw/media/browser/6a5c8845-f0f4-4469-8229-4ae9da802270.jpg`

- Page loads correctly, fetches from `/api/cron/schedule`
- Jobs show "Disabled" — expected (VendTech jobs filtered by PB IDs, none matched)

---

## Pipeline Data Check (FYI)
- 529 total prospects in pipeline
- 447 in new_lead stage
- 73 contacted
- 3 active clients
- 31 overdue tasks (check tasks.html for detail)

## Nothing New to Ship

All pages healthy. No new features built. Backlog remains empty.
