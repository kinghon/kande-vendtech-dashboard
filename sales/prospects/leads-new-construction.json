Twain Ave., Suite 115, Las Vegas NV 89135. Phone: 702-947-2000. Co-founders: Douglas Eisner, Eric Cohen. This is the #1 strategic priority.

New construction starts slowed 25% in Q1 2025. This means: (1) properties opening now are in lease-up mode and desperate for amenities, (2) new supply will tighten, meaning existing new builds will reach full occupancy and stabilize = steady revenue for vending.",

For completed/stabilized: pitch the $54/unit rent premium and passive rev share income. For pre-construction: build developer relationship NOW for guaranteed placement at opening."
