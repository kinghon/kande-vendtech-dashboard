## 1. Why College Dorms Are Perfect for Smart Vending

### The Dream Location
College dorms are arguably the **single best placement** for smart vending machines. Here's why:

- **24/7 Demand:** Students eat at ALL hours. The 11pm-3am window is a gold mine that dining halls don't serve
- **Captive Audience:** 1,000+ residents per building with no car and no nearby stores = guaranteed foot traffic
- **Young, Tech-Savvy Demo:** 18-24 year olds PREFER touchscreen, app-based, contactless payment — they expect it
- **Repeat Customers:** Same people walking past your machine 4-8 times per day for 9 months
- **Social Proof / Virality:** One student posts about the "cool AI vending machine" and the whole dorm knows
- **Meal Plan Gaps:** Dining halls close at 8-9pm. Students still need food. That's YOUR window
- **Toiletry / Convenience Items:** Forgot shampoo? Phone charger died? Need a late-night energy drink? Vending handles it
- **Institutional Revenue Share:** Universities LOVE passive revenue streams — you're literally bringing them free money

### Unit Economics (Per Machine, Per Dorm)
- Average dorm: 400-800 students
- Estimated daily transactions: 50-120 per machine
- Average transaction: $3.50-$5.00
- Monthly gross per machine: $5,250-$18,000
- After COGS + rev share: $2,000-$8,000 net/month
- ROI timeline: 3-6 months per machine

## 2. Las Vegas Market Overview

### Total Addressable Student Population

| School | Total Enrollment | On-Campus/Local | Type |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| **UNLV** | **32,911** | **~2,000+ on-campus** | Public R1 University |
| **CSN** | **~32,000** | Commuter (3 campuses) | Community College |
| **Nevada State University** | **~7,500** | New housing program | Public University |
| **Touro University Nevada** | **1,378** | Graduate/Professional | Private Non-Profit |
| **Roseman University** | **~1,500** | Graduate/Professional | Private Non-Profit |
| **Sierra Nevada University** | **~500** (Henderson campus) | Small | Private |
| **DeVry University** | **~400** | Commuter | For-Profit |
| **TOTAL** | **~76,000+** | — | — |

### Key Insight
**UNLV is the whale.** It's the ONLY school with true residential dorm infrastructure at scale. CSN is a massive commuter college (3 campuses = 3 machine locations in student unions/libraries). Nevada State is building out housing — get in early. The private schools (Touro, Roseman) are smaller but have less red tape.

---

## 3. Target Schools — Detailed Breakdown

### 🎯 TIER 1: UNLV (THE WHALE)

**University of Nevada, Las Vegas**  
4505 S. Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154  
Phone: 702-895-3011  
Total Enrollment: 32,911  

#### Residence Halls (UNLV-Owned & Operated)

| Hall | Type | Description | Vending Opportunity |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Dayton Complex** | Traditional Dorm | Suite-style bathrooms, furnished, first-year focused | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH — First-year students = most likely to use vending |
| **Tonopah Complex** | Traditional Dorm | Suite-style bathrooms, furnished, first-year focused | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH — Same as Dayton |
| **South Complex** | Traditional Dorm | Suite-style bathrooms, furnished | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH — Traditional dorm demand |
| **Upper Classmen Complex (UCC)** | Apartment-Style | Communal kitchen, suite bathrooms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH — Has kitchen but students still snack/convenience shop |

All UNLV dorms are at: **1130 University Road, Las Vegas, NV 89119**

**Key Features Across All Halls:**
- 24/7 on-site staff
- Study lounges + computer lounges on each floor
- eSports lounge (gaming = SNACKS)
- Overnight security at all complex entrances
- Included meal plans for residents (but dining halls close early)
- 9-month contracts (academic year) 
- Theme communities (STEM, Global, etc.)

#### UNLV-Affiliated Housing (U District — Separately Operated)

| Property | Type | Students | Vending Opportunity |
|----------|------|----------|-------------------|
| **The Degree** | Luxury Apartments | ~500-800 | ⭐⭐⭐ Different operator — pitch U District management directly |
| **Legacy LV** | Affordable Apartments | ~500-800 | ⭐⭐⭐ Same — approach U District management |

**U District** operates under separate lease from UNLV. Contact them independently at [liveudistrict.com](https://liveudistrict.com)

#### UNLV Campus Buildings (Non-Dorm Machine Placement)
- **Student Union Building (SU)** — Highest traffic, central campus
- **Lied Library** — Heavy study traffic, late-night hours
- **Student Recreation & Wellness Center (SRWC)** — Post-workout snacks/drinks
- **Various academic buildings** — Target buildings with 2,000+ daily users

#### Dining Situation
- UNLV has dining locations across campus (branded concepts in Student Union, etc.)
- Resident meal plans included with dorm contracts
- **Dining services likely managed by a food service provider** (Aramark or similar — needs confirmation via direct inquiry)
- **Key gap:** Dining halls close in evening → vending fills the late-night demand
- RebelCard/RebelCash system used at dining locations — **explore integration possibility** (huge selling point)

#### UNLV Contacts

**Housing & Residential Life:**
- Phone: **702-895-3489**

---

### 🎯 TIER 2: COLLEGE OF SOUTHERN NEVADA (CSN)

**3 Campuses — Commuter College (No Dorms)**
Total Enrollment: ~32,000

| Campus | Address | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Charleston Campus** | 6375 W. Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas | Largest campus |
| **North Las Vegas Campus** | 3200 E. Cheyenne Ave, North Las Vegas | Large campus |
| **Henderson Campus** | 700 College Dr, Henderson | Growing |

#### Why CSN Still Matters (No Dorms ≠ No Opportunity)
- 32,000 students across 3 campuses = massive daily foot traffic
- Student unions, libraries, break rooms all need vending
- Commuter students grab-and-go between classes
- **3 campuses = 3+ machine placements**
- Less competition — commuter colleges often have OLD legacy vending

#### CSN Procurement Contacts
- **Purchasing Department:** 702-651-2656 / purchasing2@csn.edu
- **Rolando Mosqueda, J.D.** — AVP Procurement & Auxiliary Services: 702-651-4245
- **Paula Gonzales, C.P.M.** — Director of Purchasing: 702-651-4039
- **Brandy Candelaria** — Asst. Director of Purchasing: 702-651-4361
- **Annette Lord** — Purchasing & Contracts Administrator (Auxiliary Services): 702-651-2970
- Mailing: Sort Code NLVF110, 3200 E. Cheyenne Ave, North Las Vegas, NV 89030
- **Uses NSHE SReg supplier registration system**

#### Approach for CSN
- **Contact Rolando Mosqueda directly** — he oversees both Procurement AND Auxiliary Services
- Position as "campus amenity upgrade" not just vending
- Target student unions and libraries at all 3 campuses
- Offer pilot at Charleston (largest campus) first

---

### 🎯 TIER 2: NEVADA STATE UNIVERSITY (Henderson)

**1300 Nevada State Drive, Henderson, NV 89002**  
Phone: 702-992-2000  
Enrollment: ~7,500 (growing rapidly)

#### Housing Status
- **Housing listed under Student Life** — indicates they have or are building student housing
- Formerly "Nevada State College" — recently upgraded to university status
- **Growing rapidly** = expanding campus services = perfect timing to propose smart vending
- Student Government: **NSSA (Nevada State Student Alliance)**

#### Key Departments
- **Finance & Business Operations** (procurement)
- "**Doing Business with Nevada State**" page exists in their navigation — they actively seek vendors
- Part of NSHE system — same SReg registration covers them

#### Why Nevada State is a Sleeper Hit
- New university status = trying to compete with UNLV on amenities
- Growing student body = new infrastructure being built
- Less bureaucracy than UNLV (smaller school)
- Henderson location = overlap with Kandé's existing territory
- Food Pantry listed under student services = students have food access concerns → vending with affordable options is a fit

---

### 🎯 TIER 3: TOURO UNIVERSITY NEVADA

**874 American Pacific Drive, Henderson, NV 89014**  
Enrollment: 1,378  
Type: Private, non-profit, Jewish-sponsored  

#### Programs
- Osteopathic Medicine (DO)
- Physician Assistant Studies
- Physical Therapy / Occupational Therapy
- Nursing
- Education
- Medical Health Sciences

#### Why Touro
- **Graduate/professional students = higher spending per transaction**
- Medical students study LONG hours → late-night snacking is extreme
- No dorms but students are on campus 10-14 hours/day
- Smaller school = faster decision-making, less bureaucracy
- Can pitch to Facilities or Student Affairs directly
- **Students focused on health = stock healthy options + energy drinks**

---

### 🎯 TIER 3: ROSEMAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES

**Henderson Campus:** 11 Sunset Way, Henderson, NV 89014  
**Summerlin Campus:** 10530 Discovery Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89135  
Enrollment: ~1,500  
Alumni: 9,500+

#### Programs
- College of Medicine (MD)
- College of Dental Medicine (DMD)
- College of Pharmacy (PharmD)
- College of Nursing (ABSN, DNP)
- College of Veterinary Medicine

#### Why Roseman
- **TWO campuses** (Henderson + Summerlin) = two placements

- Henderson campus has dental clinic (Roseman Dental & Orthodontics) → patients + students
- Growing institution, recently added Medical and Veterinary programs
- Contact through general administration or student services

| School | Location | Students | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Art Institute of Las Vegas** | Henderson | ~500 | Art/design students, studio hours |
| **National University** | Henderson | ~400 local | Mostly online, minimal campus |

## 4. The Pitch: "Upgrade from Legacy to AI Smart Markets"

### Core Message
> "Your students deserve better than a 1990s vending machine that eats their money and serves stale chips. Kandé VendTech brings AI-powered smart markets to your campus — touchscreen interfaces, contactless payment, real-time inventory, and product mixes tailored to YOUR students. It's not a vending machine. It's a 24/7 micro-market."

### Key Selling Points for University Decision-Makers

1. **Zero Cost to the University** — We provide, install, stock, and maintain everything
2. **Revenue Share** — The university earns passive income from every transaction
3. **Student Satisfaction** — Modern, reliable machines that accept tap/phone/card
4. **Data & Analytics** — We provide reports on what students buy, when, and how often
5. **Customizable Product Mix** — Healthy options, allergen-free, halal/kosher, cultural foods
6. **24/7 Availability** — Fills the gap when dining halls close
7. **Technology Showcase** — Positions the university as innovative and modern
8. **Sustainability** — Energy-efficient machines, reduced food waste through demand forecasting

### For Student Government Pitch
> "Imagine getting a late-night snack from a machine that has REAL food — not just candy bars. Ramen, protein bars, energy drinks, toiletries, phone chargers. Touchscreen, Apple Pay, Rebel Cash. This is what students at top universities already have."

## 5. Who to Contact at Each School

### Contact Priority Matrix

| School | Primary Contact | Secondary Contact | Student Gov Angle |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **UNLV** | Purchasing & Contracts (702-895-3521) | Housing (702-895-3489 / housing@unlv.edu) | CSUN — pitch student senators |
| **CSN** | Rolando Mosqueda, AVP (702-651-4245) | Annette Lord, Aux Services (702-651-2970) | CSN Student Government |
| **Nevada State** | Finance & Business Ops | Student Life / Housing Dept | NSSA Student Government |
| **Touro** | Campus Administration | Student Affairs | Student Council |
| **Roseman** | Campus Administration | Student Organizations | Student Orgs |

### Approach Order
1. **UNLV Housing** — Direct email to housing@unlv.edu with pilot proposal
2. **UNLV Purchasing** — Register as NSHE vendor at suppliers.nevada.edu
3. **CSN Purchasing** — Call Rolando Mosqueda
4. **Nevada State** — Explore "Doing Business" process
5. **Touro/Roseman** — Direct admin pitch (smaller = faster)

---

## 6. Navigating University Procurement

### NSHE System (Covers UNLV, CSN, Nevada State)

**Step 1: Register as NSHE Supplier**
- Go to **https://suppliers.nevada.edu**
- Create account in SReg system
- List commodity offerings (vending services, micro-markets, food service equipment)
- **One registration covers ALL 8 NSHE institutions** — huge advantage

**Step 2: Understanding the Process**
- NSHE institutions follow Nevada state procurement law
- Contracts under $50,000 may be approved at the department level
- Larger contracts typically require RFP (Request for Proposal) process
- **Vending/food service contracts are usually handled by Auxiliary Services**

**Step 3: Multiple Entry Points**
1. **Formal RFP Route:** Watch for posted RFPs on NSHE/UNLV procurement sites
2. **Direct Pitch:** Contact auxiliary services/housing and propose a pilot
3. **Student Government Route:** Get CSUN to request smart vending → university responds
4. **Facilities Route:** Contact facilities management about replacing aging vending equipment

### Private Schools (Touro, Roseman)
- No NSHE bureaucracy — direct pitch to administration
- Usually just need approval from facilities/operations manager
- Can sign agreement directly with campus contact
- Faster timeline: pitch → decision in 2-4 weeks

### The Pilot Program Hack
Universities are risk-averse. They hate committing to new vendors. **The solution: a free pilot.**
- "Let us put ONE machine in your highest-traffic dorm lobby for 90 days, completely free"
- "If students love it, we expand. If not, we remove it at zero cost to you"
- This bypasses the full RFP process (small enough to be a trial/demo)
- Gets the machine on campus → data proves the case → full contract follows

---

## 7. Pricing Strategy for Universities

### Revenue Share Model (Recommended)
| Tier | University Share | Kandé Share | When |
|------|----------------|-------------|------|
| **Pilot (0-90 days)** | 0% | 100% | Free trial period |
| **Standard** | 10-15% of gross | 85-90% | Normal operation |
| **Premium Placement** | 15-20% of gross | 80-85% | Student Union, Library lobby |
| **Exclusive Campus Deal** | 12-18% of gross | 82-88% | Multi-machine campus-wide |

### Why Revenue Share > Flat Fee
- Universities prefer % of sales (no upfront cost, scales with usage)
- Aligns incentives — they want the machine to succeed too
- Common industry standard — Aramark/Canteen do the same
- Makes the "zero risk" pitch credible

### Student Discount Integration
- Consider RebelCash / student ID integration → 5-10% student discount
- "Students pay less, university earns commission, everybody wins"
- Creates loyalty and increases transaction volume
- Positions Kandé as student-friendly

## Appendix A: Competitive Analysis

### Who's Currently in University Vending?

| Company | Presence | Strength | Weakness |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Aramark** | Major university food service | Massive scale, existing relationships | Old-school vending, slow to innovate |
| **Sodexo** | Major university food service | Similar to Aramark | Same legacy issues |
| **Canteen (Compass)** | Vending-specific | Established vending routes | Basic machines, no smart tech |
| **USConnect** | Micro-markets | Growing in corporate | Less university presence |
| **365 Retail Markets** | Micro-market kiosks | Technology-forward | More office/corporate focused |

### Kandé's Edge
- **AI-powered** vs. their basic machines
- **Better product curation** vs. their one-size-fits-all
- **Local operator** vs. their national bureaucracy
- **Faster decision-making** — can customize per campus
- **Modern UX** — touchscreen, app integration, student-friendly
- **Data transparency** — share analytics with university partners

---

## Appendix B: UNLV Campus Map Key Locations

### Highest-Traffic Vending Spots
1. **Residence Hall Lobbies** — captive audience, 24/7 access
2. **Student Union Building (SU)** — central campus hub
3. **Lied Library** — extends to late-night study hours
4. **Student Recreation & Wellness Center (SRWC)** — post-workout demand
5. **Academic buildings** near lecture halls — between-class grab-and-go
6. **Hospitality Hall** — UNLV's famous hospitality program = food-savvy students

---

## Appendix C: Talking Points — Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a vending contract" | "When does it expire? We'd love to be considered for the next cycle. In the meantime, can we pilot a smart machine in an underserved location?" |
| "We'd need to do an RFP" | "Understood. Can we do a small pilot first? Under $50K typically doesn't require a full RFP. Let us prove the concept with one machine." |
| "Our students won't use it" | "College students are the #1 vending demographic. We'll guarantee performance — if it doesn't hit targets, we remove it free." |
| "We don't have the budget" | "There's no cost to you. We provide everything. You earn revenue share from Day 1." |
| "What about maintenance?" | "We handle all maintenance remotely and in-person. Our machines self-report issues. Average response time under 24 hours." |
| "We're concerned about healthy options" | "20% of our product mix is healthy. We'll work with your nutrition services to customize. We can even label calorie counts on the touchscreen." |
