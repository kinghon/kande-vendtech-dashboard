## Email 1 (Day 0)
**Subject:** `{{company_name}}`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I run a smart vending company here in Las Vegas — cutting edge AI smart coolers with fresh and healthy food options, snacks, and drinks. We stock and maintain everything at zero cost to you. It's a free luxury amenity for your staff and visitors.

Would {{company_name}} have space for something like that?

We're local to Las Vegas and focus on excellent service and making sure our machines are never empty.

Thanks!
Kurtis Hon
CEO
