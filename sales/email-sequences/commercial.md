## Email 1: The Opener
**Send:** Day 0 (immediate)  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `{{first_name}}, quick question about the breakroom`
- B: `tenant amenities at {{company_name}}`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I work with commercial buildings in {{city}} on their vending and breakroom solutions, and had a quick question.

How's the current vending setup at {{company_name}}? I ask because most buildings I visit either have machines from 2010 that barely work, or they got rid of vending entirely because the last vendor was unreliable.

We provide modern cashless vending machines — fully managed, zero cost to the building. We handle installation, restocking, maintenance, all of it. Buildings earn a monthly commission, and tenants get a real amenity instead of an afterthought.

Worth a quick chat to see if it's a fit?

**Word count:** 111  
**CTA:** "Worth a quick chat?"  
**Notes:** The "machines from 2010" line resonates hard because it's true for most commercial buildings. It positions you as someone who actually visits buildings and knows the reality.

## Email 2: The Tenant/Employee Angle
**Send:** Day 3  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `Re: {{first_name}}, quick question about the breakroom`
- B: `the amenity tenants actually notice`

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Following up on my last note. Something I hear a lot from building managers:

"We spent thousands upgrading the lobby, but people spend their actual time in the breakroom."

That's where modern vending fits. It's one of those small upgrades that tenants and employees notice immediately:

→ Cashless payment (Apple Pay, cards, mobile)
→ Fresh snacks and drinks, not the same stale stuff
→ Clean, modern machines that actually look good
→ Reliable — if something's off, we fix it fast

And the best part? It doesn't cost the building a dime. We install, stock, and maintain everything. You get a commission check.

Interested in learning more?

**CTA:** "Interested in learning more?"  
**Notes:** The lobby vs. breakroom insight is a genuine observation that building managers relate to. It shows you think about their world differently than typical vendors.

## Email 3: The ROI / Business Case
**Send:** Day 7  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `zero cost, zero effort, monthly commission`
- B: `{{first_name}}, a different kind of vendor conversation`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I realize I should spell out exactly how this works, because it's different from the usual vendor pitch:

1. We install modern cashless vending machines in your building — at our cost
2. We stock and maintain them on a regular schedule — you never think about it
3. The building earns a monthly commission based on sales
4. If it doesn't work out, we remove the machines — no contracts, no hassle

You don't buy anything. You don't manage anything. You just get an upgraded amenity and a new revenue stream.

Most building managers I talk to say "that sounds too good to be true" — then they see the machines and say "why didn't we do this sooner?"

Do you have 10 minutes this week for a quick call? I can answer any questions and see if your building is a fit.

**Word count:** 138  
**CTA:** "10 minutes this week"  
**Notes:** The numbered list makes the business case crystal clear. Addressing the "too good to be true" objection head-on neutralizes it. This is the longest email in the sequence — it earns the length because it's the full pitch.

## Email 4: The Breakup
**Send:** Day 12  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `closing the loop, {{first_name}}`
- B: `am I reaching the right person?`

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about upgrading the vending at {{company_name}} and haven't heard back. Totally understand — building management is a full-time-plus job.

Quick question: am I reaching the right person for amenity and vendor decisions? If someone else handles this, I'd appreciate a pointer in the right direction.

If the timing just isn't right, no problem at all. The offer stands whenever you're ready — zero cost vending with full service and monthly commissions.

Thanks either way.

**Word count:** 92  
**CTA:** Referral request  
**Notes:** "Am I reaching the right person?" in the subject line gets high open rates because it triggers curiosity. The email itself is short and direct — by email 4, nobody wants a long pitch.

## Email 5 (Optional): The Hail Mary
**Send:** Day 21  
**Subject Lines:**
- A: `{{first_name}} — last one, promise`
- B: `just in case`

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Last email from me. If the vending at {{company_name}} ever needs an upgrade, we're a quick email away.

Zero cost. Full service. Modern machines your tenants will actually use.

Have a great week.

Kurtis
```

**Word count:** 35  
**CTA:** None  
**Notes:** Shortest possible. "Last one, promise" signals respect. Some of the best replies come from hail mary emails because they're so low-pressure.

## Commercial-Specific Notes

### Best Sending Times
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 8:00-10:00 AM** — before the day fills with walkthroughs and meetings
- **Also effective: 1:00-2:00 PM** — post-lunch email check
- **Avoid Mondays** — Monday morning inbox overload
- **Avoid Friday afternoons** — checkout mode

### Title Targeting Priority
1. Building Manager / Property Manager (direct decision maker)
2. Facilities Manager / Director of Facilities
3. Director of Operations / VP of Operations
4. Office Manager / Workplace Manager (smaller buildings)
5. Asset Manager (investment-focused, cares about revenue angle)
6. Tenant Relations Manager (cares about tenant satisfaction angle)

### Segment Strategies

**Class A Office Buildings (premium)**
- Emphasize: modern aesthetics, cashless tech, brand alignment
- Language: "premium," "tenant experience," "building standard"
- These buildings care about appearance first, revenue second

**Class B/C Office Buildings**
- Emphasize: zero cost, revenue generation, easy upgrade
- Language: "upgrade," "zero investment," "monthly commission"
- These buildings care about revenue and reducing hassle

**Coworking Spaces**
- Emphasize: member experience, community building, modern vibe
- Language: "member perk," "community amenity," "startup-friendly"
- Shorter decision cycles — often a single person decides

**Industrial Parks / Business Parks**
- Emphasize: worker convenience, 24/7 access, durable machines
- Language: "break area," "shift workers," "heavy-duty"
- Focus on the employee convenience angle over aesthetics

## Expected Metrics

| Metric | Target | Good | Great |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Open Rate | 42%+ | 48-58% | 62%+ |
| Reply Rate | 3-5% | 5-7% | 9%+ |
| Positive Reply | 1-2% | 2-4% | 5%+ |
| Meeting Book | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 3%+ |
| Bounce Rate | <3% | <2% | <1% |

> **Note:** Commercial/office contacts tend to have the best email deliverability because corporate email systems are more predictable than healthcare or multifamily. Open rates should be higher in this vertical.

## Objection Handling (for replies)

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We already have a vendor" | "Totally understand. Out of curiosity, are they keeping up with restocking and maintenance? Happy to be a backup option if things ever change." |
| "No space for machines" | "We work with buildings of all sizes — sometimes a single slim machine in the breakroom is all it takes. Worth a quick look?" |
| "Not my decision" | "Appreciate the honesty! Who would be the right person to talk to about this?" |
| "Send me more info" | Send a one-page PDF with photos, commission structure, and 3 bullet points. Follow up in 3 days. |
| "What's the catch?" | "No catch — we own the machines, we make money on product sales, you get a cut and a better amenity. Happy to hop on a call and walk through exactly how it works." |
| "We got rid of vending" | "I hear that a lot — usually because the last vendor dropped the ball. We're built differently. Would you be open to trying one machine and seeing the difference?" |
