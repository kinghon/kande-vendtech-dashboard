## Email 1: The Opener
**Send:** Day 0 (immediate)  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `{{first_name}}, quick question about {{company_name}}`
- B: `amenities at {{company_name}}`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I manage vending services for apartment communities in {{city}} and had a quick question.

Do residents at {{company_name}} currently have access to vending machines in common areas? I've been working with several communities in the area and noticed most are either missing this amenity entirely or stuck with outdated machines that nobody uses.

We install modern cashless vending machines at zero cost to the property — we handle everything from installation to stocking to maintenance. Properties earn a monthly commission just for hosting.

Worth a quick conversation?

## Email 2: The Value Drop
**Send:** Day 3  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `Re: {{first_name}}, quick question about {{company_name}}`
- B: `the amenity gap I keep seeing in {{city}}`

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Circling back on my last note. Wanted to share what we're seeing with apartment communities that have added our vending:

→ Residents actually use it (cashless payment + modern snack/drink selection)
→ Zero cost to the property, zero management
→ Monthly commission check for doing nothing extra
→ Residents mention it in reviews (yes, really)

Most properties we talk to are surprised they can add an amenity that generates revenue instead of costing money. It's a pretty different conversation from the usual vendor pitch.

Happy to share more details if there's any interest on your end.

## Email 3: The Social Proof
**Send:** Day 7  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `what other {{city}} properties are doing`
- B: `quick update, {{first_name}}`

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know you're busy — managing properties doesn't leave a lot of time for vendor emails.

I'll keep this brief: we just placed machines at a community in the {{city}} area and they've been getting consistent daily traffic from day one. The property manager told me she wished she'd done it sooner because it was one of the easiest amenity additions she's handled.

No contracts, no investment, no maintenance on your end. If it doesn't work out, we just pick up the machine.

Would it make sense to chat for 10 minutes this week?

```

**Word count:** 101  
**CTA:** Specific — "10 minutes this week"  
**Notes:** Acknowledges they're busy (empathy). Risk reversal with "we just pick up the machine."

## Email 4: The Breakup
**Send:** Day 12  
**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `closing the loop`
- B: `not the right time?`

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about vending for {{company_name}} and haven't heard back, which usually means one of three things:

1. You're swamped (totally get it)
2. This isn't relevant right now
3. Someone else handles this decision

If it's #3, would you mind pointing me in the right direction? And if it's #1 or #2, no worries at all — I'll stop filling up your inbox.

Either way, the offer stands whenever the timing works. We install modern cashless vending machines at zero cost, and properties earn a commission.

Thanks for your time, {{first_name}}.

**Word count:** 108  
**CTA:** Asks for referral or permission to stop  
**Notes:** The numbered list is psychologically proven to get responses. #3 gives them an easy out that still generates a referral.

## Email 5 (Optional): The Hail Mary
**Send:** Day 21  
**Subject Lines:**
- A: `{{first_name}} — one last thing`
- B: `☝️`

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Last note from me. Just wanted to leave you with this:

If you ever want to explore adding vending as an amenity at {{company_name}}, we're here. Zero cost, full service, and we make it stupid easy.

Have a great rest of your week.

Kurtis
```

**Word count:** 42  
**CTA:** None — pure warmth  
**Notes:** Ultra-short. The ☝️ subject line is unconventional and gets high open rates. This email often gets the reply because it's disarming.
