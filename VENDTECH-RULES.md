## ❌ BAD LOCATIONS — NEVER RESEARCH OR RECOMMEND
- Weightlifting gyms / fitness centers — "Wrong buyers. Count macros. Avoid impulse snacks."
- Big retail chain breakrooms — "Staff bring meals. Skeleton crews. Usually empty."
- Medical offices — "People come and go fast. Low traffic. High disappointment."
- Small offices under 50 employees — not enough volume
- The Strip — dominated by 1 company with near-monopoly
- Auto dealerships — low priority, skip

## ✅ GOOD LOCATIONS — PRIORITIZE THESE
- Apartments (200+ units) — captive audience, 24/7
- Healthcare facilities (hospitals, NOT small medical offices) — shift workers, 24/7
- Large offices (100+ employees) — daytime traffic
- Senior living — captive, consistent
- College dorms — 24/7, young demo, impulse buyers
- Distribution centers / warehouses — 24/7 shifts, no food options
- Call centers — high density, shift workers, snackers
- Government buildings — stable, long contracts
- Hotels/casinos EMPLOYEE areas (back of house) — huge workforces
- Data centers — 24/7, isolated, captive
- Construction staging yards — early starts, grab-and-go

## 🧠 PROSPECTING MINDSET
- Think like a HUMAN SALESPERSON driving around, not a bot searching categories
- Ask: "Where are the PEOPLE?" — large captive workforces, shift workers, people stuck somewhere
- Geographic sweeps > category searches. Drive-by mentality.
- Look for CLUSTERS — 3 buildings on the same block = one efficient route
- Think about TIMING — who's there at 2 AM? Night shifts = gold
- Look for PAIN — outdated machines, no food options nearby, cafeteria closes at 5 PM
- Look for WHALES — one relationship that opens 5-10+ locations (property mgmt companies, hospital systems, corporate HQs with multiple buildings)
- Don't just list companies — explain WHY each one is a good target

## 🔑 SALES RULES
- NEVER say "vending" — use "AI-powered smart markets" or "amenities"
- 8-10 touchpoints to close a deal — build into all task automation
- Pop-ins with gift baskets > cold calls
- Rev share 3-5% of gross to lock out competition
- Minimum $2K/month revenue potential per location or don't bother
- Qualify: employee/resident count, shifts, foot traffic, existing vending
- Greystar = NetVendor certification required
- Holland = vendor approval process
- Referral strategy: "Introduce me to 3 other buildings"

## 🏗️ OPERATIONS RULES
- Route efficiency is #1 scaling bottleneck
- Restock based on sales velocity, not fixed schedule
- Product mix varies by location type
- Track theft/vandalism per machine
- Flag locations under $2K/month for review/relocation

## 📧 OUTREACH RULES
- Don't start sending until warmup complete (~2 weeks)
- Start at 25 emails/day, text-only, no tracking pixels initially
- Subject lines: short, personal, no spam words
- CAN-SPAM compliant always
