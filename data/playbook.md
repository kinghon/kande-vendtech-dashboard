## 1. Executive Summary

**The business in a nutshell:** Vending is a foot-traffic game with predictable, recurring revenue once machines are placed in qualified locations. The operators who scale fastest treat every location like a real estate investment, sell relentlessly, and hire before they think they're ready.

- **Target 60–65% gross margin** on ambient products, accept 45–50% on frozen. Price to gas-station parity or slightly above — never Walmart.
- **Class A luxury apartments (200+ units)** and **medical outpatient facilities (150+ staff + 100+ daily patients)** are the two highest-performing location types. Mailroom/package-room placement beats everything else in residential.
- **Sales cycle is long** — 10–12 weeks average, sometimes 6–8 months. 1-in-10 pop-in conversion rate. Never stop prospecting.
- **The $54 rent premium pitch** is your closer for property managers: vending/convenience amenities equate to $54/unit in premium rent.
- **Finance machines, conserve cash** for hiring, inventory, and warehouse. 0% APR business credit cards are the community's go-to.
- **Hire stockers early.** The opportunity cost of missed pop-ins because you're restocking far exceeds a stocker's wage. Always have 2+ part-timers for redundancy.
- **Micro-markets outperform smart coolers by 50–100%** in revenue. Favor open-market format where the location allows it.
- **Revenue is predictable after ~5 months** — plus or minus 5% each month (Anthony). Weekly payouts from vending processors give solid cash flow.
- **Best-performing operators** hit **$35K–$102K/month** within 18–24 months. Shannon's single micro-market location does **$22K–$25K/month**.

## 2. Pricing Strategy

### Core Rules

| Rule | Target | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Minimum gross margin per item | **50%** | Kyle Davey |
| Target margin — ambient products | **60–65%** | Anthony, Lane Folkers |
| Target margin — frozen items | **45–50%** | Anthony |
| Target overall margin | **~60%** | Lane Folkers |
| Rule-of-thumb markup | **3× cost** (except when COGS > $2) | Jason Carlin |
| Net margin after fees, labor, overhead | **30–35%** | Skool community consensus |

### Pricing Psychology & Tactics

- **Start higher, adjust down** — underpricing is harder to recover from (Jason Carlin)
- **Use psychological pricing** — $3.95 not $4.00, $2.49 not $2.50 (Ben Miller)
- **Cluster pricing by category** — all chips at one price, all energy drinks at one price. Simplifies customer experience (Kyle Davey)
- **Price to gas-station parity or slightly above** — that's the benchmark, NOT Walmart (Lane Folkers)
- **Smart stores often don't show shelf prices** — customers see price at POS, reducing sensitivity (Lane Folkers)
- **Apartments tolerate higher pricing** due to the convenience factor — especially luxury
- **White-collar offices are more price-sensitive** — surveys show complaints about pricing "42% higher than Walmart." Consider offering cheaper cans alongside premium bottles at these sites
- **Prioritize profit per unit over margin percentage** — a $5 item at 40% margin = $2 profit beats a $2 item at 60% = $1.20 (Anthony)
- **Evaluate freezer performance at the freezer level**, not by individual item (Skool Weekly Call)

### Category-Specific Pricing

| Category | COGS | Retail | Margin | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Energy drinks (Red Bull 8.4oz) | ~$2.00 | $3.75–3.99 | ~47–50% | Highest velocity category |
| Energy drinks (Red Bull 12oz) | ~$2.50 | $4.99 | ~50% | |
| Chips/snacks | ~$0.60–1.00 | $2.49 | ~60–75% | |
| Regular candy | ~$0.50–0.75 | $1.75–2.00 | ~60–70% | |
| King-size candy | ~$1.25 | $3.39 | ~63% | |
| Cans of soda | $0.36 | $1.00–2.00 | ~64–82% | Buy on sale, load up for 3 months |
| Ramen | ~$0.30–0.50 | $1.50–2.00 | ~70%+ | Sells exceptionally well |
| Pop-Tarts | ~$0.50 | $1.75–2.00 | ~65–70% | High-margin and popular |
| Core Water | $0.93 | $2.99 | ~69% | "Highest velocity seller" — $1.70 net/bottle after fees |
| Fair Life Core Power 42g protein | ~$3.50 | $7.99 | ~56% | "Flying off shelves — meal replacement" |
| Sandwiches (Costco) | $3.84–5.00 | $7.00–8.25 | ~40–55% | Higher absolute profit |
| Salads | $3.00 | $7.65 | ~61% | $4.65 profit per salad |
| Toilet paper (Charmin 6-pack) | ~$8.00 | $16.99 | ~50%+ | Shannon sells 2–3/week |

### Bottles vs. Cans

- **Prefer bottles over cans** — higher dollar profit per unit (Lane Folkers)
- 16.9oz bottles preferred for margin and shelf life; transition to 20oz when feasible
- In some markets, operators price cans = bottles (e.g., $4 in LA)
- Cans still needed in price-sensitive markets — use as "relationship sacrifices"

### Revenue Share Models

| Model | Range | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| No rev share | **$0** | Push for this when possible |
| Flat monthly | **$25/month** | Simplest approach |
| Percentage of gross | **3–5%** | Most common |
| Tiered/sliding | Tied to monthly volume | **Recommended** — protects you when sales are weak |

## 3. Location Strategy

### Top Location Types (Ranked by Performance)

#### 1. High-Rise Apartment Towers (Downtown, with Airbnb units)
- **Expected revenue:** $6K–7K/month (open market format)
- **Why:** Airbnb guest traffic is a massive bonus; forced foot traffic through lobbies
- **Shannon's unicorn:** High-rise apartments + condos + long-term hotel combo in Seattle = **$22K–$25K/month** from a single micro-market

#### 2. Class A Luxury Apartments
- **Minimum threshold:** **200+ units**
- **Expected revenue:** $2,195+/month per Stockwell machine (first-month case study, Houston); higher with open-market format
- **Revenue per apartment unit:** **$8–10/month**
- **Why they crush it:** 24/7 access, residents have disposable income, not price-conscious. Residents won't walk 2–3 blocks to a convenience store at 11:30 PM — they'll take the elevator
- **Leasing advantage:** Property managers love it as a tour amenity
- **The $54 stat:** Having vending/convenience inside a building equates to **$54/unit in premium rent**
- **Critical rule:** **Single building ONLY. Garden-style apartments are a HARD PASS** (unless mailroom placement works)
- **Scaling hack:** The property management company usually manages OTHER properties — one relationship can unlock multiple locations
- **Enter early at new developments** — even at 0% occupancy. Long-term relationship advantage

#### 3. Medical Outpatient Facilities
- **Minimum threshold:** **150 employees + 100 patients daily** (250+ total foot traffic)
- **Why Anthony loves these:** "I wish I could add more of these to my portfolio"
  - Doctors/nurses work 12-hour shifts, grab Fair Life protein ($7.99) as meal replacements
  - High-income staff = not price-conscious
  - Patients waiting 30–45 min buy impulsively
  - **Recession-proof** — people always need to see doctors
  - High-stress environment → impulsive buying
- **Pro tip:** Ask if the facility uses **Placer AI** — one facility sent Anthony 3 years of foot traffic data (400 patients/day M–F)

#### 4. Multi-Shift Warehouse/Manufacturing Facilities
- **Minimum threshold:** **150 employees**
- **Expected revenue:** **$10K+/month** (but competitive market)
- **Why:** Captive audience, limited nearby food options, short 15-min breaks = workers can't leave
- **Best format:** Micro-market in employee break room
- **Qualifying questions:**
  - "How stable is the company? Are you growing?"
  - "How many employees per shift?" (Don't assume — Anthony once assumed 75 on 2nd shift when it was 3)
  - "Are you opening new divisions or hiring?"

#### 5. Large Office Buildings
- **Minimum threshold:** **200+ employees**
- **Note:** White-collar sites are more price-sensitive — may need to offer cheaper can options alongside premium bottles

#### 6. Student Housing
- **High volume** but watch for theft — requires secure equipment

### Placement Within the Building

> "If you place it in the wrong part of the building, it could decrease your sales by 25%." — Anthony

**Best placements (ranked):**
1. **Mailroom / package room** — consistently strongest performer in residential
2. **Elevator lobbies** — forced foot traffic
3. **Building lobby / amenity lounge** — high visibility
4. **Break rooms** (offices/industrial) — captive audience

**Avoid:**
- Fitness centers — consistently underperform
- Pool areas — consistently underperform
- Time-restricted common rooms — hours kill sales
- Anywhere visible from the street — invites vandalism (Kyle Davey)

**Always ask the property manager:** "Where's the most foot traffic in the building?" They know where people congregate. Push back diplomatically if they suggest a suboptimal spot.

### Location Red Flags 🚩

- **Convenience store within a couple blocks** — kills your traffic
- **Placing machines for YOUR convenience** — Anthony put a machine 5 min from his house; it only did $700–800/month
- **Not asking about shift sizes** — always get numbers per shift
- **Garden-style apartments** — hard pass (limited traffic, theft risk)
- **Locations too far from your hub** — Shannon keeps a **10–15 mile radius max**; turned down a 69-mile opportunity
- **Under 150 employees** (industrial) or **under 200 units** (residential)
- **Free snack programs** — ask: "Do you supply snacks for free?" If yes, that undercuts your machine
- **Government contracts with heavy rev share + insurance requirements** — one operator got only $700/month with 15% rev share
- **89-unit properties** — one case study showed only $97 first week despite "good lobby location"

### Location Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Unit count / employee count meets minimums (200+ res, 150+ industrial)
- [ ] Occupancy rate (>90% ideal)
- [ ] 24/7 access confirmed
- [ ] No convenience store within 2–3 blocks
- [ ] No free snack program
- [ ] Best placement spot available (mailroom, lobby, break room)
- [ ] Within 15-mile service radius
- [ ] Company is stable/growing (industrial)
- [ ] Property manager is receptive + manages other properties
- [ ] Not visible from the street

### Equipment by Location Type

| Location Type | Recommended Equipment | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Premium high-rise | Stockwell (365) | Reliable, secure, higher fees |
| Large property (200+) | PicoVision combo | Better capacity |
| Standard apartment | Haha Pro | Cost-effective |
| Micro-market format | Moneta kiosk | Best service, lower fees than 365 |
| Open market | Cantaloupe (swap kiosk for Moneta) | Reduce fees |
| High-security needed | Traditional machines | Only where location requires protection |

**Key insight from Anthony:** AI smart coolers are far superior to traditional machines — "90% of issues can be troubleshot remotely." Traditional machines are a "pain in the butt — coils, cash box, coin dispenser, so many things can go wrong." Use traditional only where location demands it.

**Micro-markets consistently outperform** traditional vending and smart coolers, often **50–100% more revenue** in the same location.

## 4. Sales & Pop-in Strategy

### The Pitch

> "Vending machines is by far the easiest sales job I've ever had. There's almost no objections." — Kyle ($40K/month)

**Core pitch elements:**

1. **Frame it as an amenity, not a vendor placement** — "You're providing an amenity to the building." Leasing agents use it to show potential tenants
2. **Drop the $54 stat** — "A study showed having convenience inside a building equates to $54/unit in premium rent. On a 250-unit building, that's $13,500/year in additional NOI for the owner"
3. **Use the distributor advantage** — When property managers ask "You're not just buying from Costco, right?" → "I got a distributor with 5,000 SKUs. You want Starbucks, all gummies, spicy Gardetto Italian trail mix — you got it." (This closed deals against competitors who only had variety packs — Anthony)
4. **Don't use "vending" language** — Position as "smart market" or "AI-powered convenience" to improve perception
5. **Ask for referrals every time** — "What other properties do you manage? Do you know other people?" Property managers are all friends; it's a small industry. Anthony gets 1–2 referrals/month just from reputation now

### Pop-in Cadence

- **Kyle's approach:** Pop-ins 1–2× per week when actively growing
- **Anthony's approach:** **15–20 pop-ins in a single day** (batch on a Saturday or flexible weekday)
- **Conversion rate:** Roughly **1 in 10** (sometimes 3 in 10, sometimes 0 in 20 — "law of averages, it always averages out")
- **Never stop pop-ins** — even after landing first locations. "Stopped doing pop-ins after landing first location — big mistake. Momentum matters!" (Thomas Rohlader)

### Sales Cycle

> "It's the longest sales cycle I've ever had. Sometimes it takes 10–12 weeks or even longer. 6, 7, 8 months I've been chasing some leads." — Kyle

- **Average:** ~10–12 weeks from first contact to placement
- **Range:** Same week (unicorn) to 8+ months
- **Typical:** ~3 months to close a location (Skool consensus)
- **Key insight for Kande's 91 prospects:** Don't give up. Kyle's explosive Q2 was just old leads finally saying yes — "all these yeses just kind of started trickling in for leads I'd been talking to for months"
- **Follow-up is everything.** Use a CRM religiously — "Have a CRM so you don't lose track of your leads" (Kyle)

### Qualifying Questions (During Pop-ins)

- Where's the most foot traffic in the building?
- How many units / employees? (Get specific per shift)
- Do you supply snacks for free?
- What are your business hours? 24/7 access?
- Is the company growing / hiring?
- Is it near the package room or amenity lounge?
- Do you manage other properties?
- Is there a convenience store within a few blocks?

### Mindset on Rejection

> "For every door I knocked on trying to sell a newspaper subscription, I was probably 1 for 50. But when I got that one, I made 150 bucks as a 14-year-old." — Kyle

- In baseball, you strike out 7/10 times and still make the All-Star game
- Don't get discouraged by individual rejections — results come in waves
- "If you're not out there hustling to get it, somebody else is going to." — Kyle
- When a competitor sent Kyle a cease-and-desist letter to bully him out, his response: "Let's go. Game on, buddy." He went harder.

## 5. Operations

### Restocking Frequency

| Location Type | Frequency | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Unicorn / high-volume | 3–4× per week | Shannon's $25K location: Mon, Wed, Fri + Sat/Sun |
| Open market (tower) | 2–3× per week | Skool benchmarks |
| Standard / moderate | Every 3–4 days | Community consensus |
| Low-volume | 1× per week | Small offices |

**Critical lesson:** Shannon's first location sold out in **48 hours** — be prepared to adjust cadence fast.

### Inventory Management

- **Early stage (1–5 machines):** You can eyeball it
- **At scale (15–25+ machines):** You MUST systemize
  - Create scheduled sales analysis per machine
  - Track what's selling vs. sitting
  - Restock BEFORE machines run low — use software to track stockouts
  - Kyle: "I walked into the warehouse and the Coke rack was full. After one day of restocking, almost empty. I had to systemize."
- **Align delivery days** from different vendors when possible
- **Use insulated containers** (Cambro boxes) for temperature-sensitive products

### The Variety Pack Problem

> "I would order Gatorade Zero and it would come in a variety pack — fruit punch, glacier cherry, lemon lime. Lemon lime sells 3× more." — Anthony

- **Effective cost per unit with variety packs is 50+ cents HIGHER** due to waste/oversupply of unpopular flavors
- **Solution:** Use distributor relationships to order single-SKU cases
- This applies to ANY variety pack from Costco/Sam's

### Sourcing Strategy

| Supplier | Best For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Sam's Club** | Beverages, bulk items | Far cheaper than VendHub for most drinks |
| **Costco Business Center** | Sandwiches, variety, single-SKU | Ham/turkey sandwiches $3.84 → $8.25 retail |
| **Vistar** | Variety, bulk, rebates | $750 min order to avoid shipping |
| **Walmart** | Fill-in items, bagged candy | Pick-up ordering convenient |
| **VendHub** | Hard-to-source SKUs, quality fresh | Better quality wraps/sandwiches than Walmart |
| **Distributors (general)** | Single-SKU cases, rebates, delivery | **Rebate checks: 3–12%** quarterly. Competitive advantage in pitches |

**Critical:** **Register as a reseller immediately** at Costco/Sam's to avoid paying sales tax — "no way to claw back sales tax after paying" (Thomas Rohlader)

**Pro tip:** Buy cans of soda on sale and "load up for 3 months" (Michael Deese)

### Top-Selling Products (Community-Wide)

| Product | Price Point | Why It Works |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Smartwater 20oz** | — | Shannon's #1 seller ($6K/month in water alone at unicorn) |
| **Core Water** | $2.99 | "Highest velocity seller" — $1.70 net/bottle after fees |
| **Coke Zero 20oz** | — | Anthony's top seller across route |
| **Monster / Red Bull** | $3.75–4.99 | Highest velocity category overall |
| **Fair Life Core Power 42g protein** | $7.99 | "Flying off shelves — meal replacement" at medical/office sites |
| **Gatorade Zero Lemon Lime** | — | Sells 3× more than other Gatorade flavors |
| **Cheetos Flamin' Hot** | $2.49 | Top seller in Houston case study (38 units first month) |
| **Snickers** | $1.75–3.39 | Perennial top seller |
| **Skinny Pop White Cheddar 1oz** | — | Anthony hunted Dollar Trees for this before getting distributor access |
| **Ramen** | $1.50–2.00 | 70%+ margin, sells exceptionally well |
| **Pop-Tarts** | $1.75–2.00 | 65%+ margin, consistently popular |

### Non-Traditional / Convenience Items (Residential)

- **Toilet paper (Charmin 6-pack):** $16.99 sell, ~$8 cost = 50%+ margin. Shannon sells 2–3/week
- **Paper towels, laundry pods** — convenience items residents don't want to go out for
- **Advil, Excedrin, cough drops** — "Our incidentals actually do really well" (Shannon)
- **Condoms, shampoo, conditioner** — sell surprisingly well at apartments
- **Dog treats** — Anthony adding by customer request
- **Room-temperature water** — some customers specifically want this (Shannon added 40 bottles near checkout)

### Planogram Strategy

- **Do a thorough planogram with real product dimensions** before stocking
- Test-fit tall bottles — bottle heights reduce usable shelves
- Use chip/snack dividers with spring pressure for consistent fronting
- Start with generalized layouts, adjust based on local demand
- Focus on proven top sellers first (Coke, Diet Coke, Gatorade, Fairlife), then experiment
- **Healthy items:** Stock if required to close a deal, but monitor performance and rotate. Despite manager preferences, **top sellers remain energy drinks, candy, and frozen items**

### Software & Reporting

| Platform | Reporting | Payouts | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **365/Stockwell** | Robust "Sales Analysis" reporting | Weekly (Fridays) | "Bulletproof on payment capture" |
| **Haha** | merchant.hahavending.com exports | On-demand (2 free/month) | Device/product rankings with gross margin |
| **Moneta** | Good micro-market tools | Weekly (Wed/Thu) | Best service quality |
| **MicroMart** | Scheduling features | Varies | Smart cooler specific |
| **QuickBooks Solopreneur** | P&L tracking | — | Adequate and cheap for early stage |
| **VenSoft** | Multi-platform consolidation | — | For operators with mixed equipment |

### Connectivity

- **Dedicated routers > SIM cards** for stability
- Run speed tests pre-install
- **Haha router:** ~$15/month; remove SIM after confirming Wi-Fi
- **Cellular options:** WTI ($25/month), OptConnect ($45/month)
- Some enterprises prohibit third-party payment on their Wi-Fi — use cellular gateways

### Warehouse & Storage Progression

| Stage | Setup | When |
|-------|-------|------|
| Start | Living room / garage | Month 1–6 (Shannon ran 800 sq ft home for 6 months) |
| Growth | Storage unit with 24/7 access | 5–10 machines |
| Scale | Dedicated warehouse with receiving capability | 15+ machines |

**Key feature needed:** A place that can receive deliveries when you're not there is a game-changer (Kyle).

Kyle's turning point: Getting a warehouse in the city where his machines are (1 hour from home) and hiring a local stocker — "That was a game changer... now this really feels like a business."

## 6. Scaling Playbook

### Growth Milestones & Timeline

| Milestone | Timeline | Revenue | Operator |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| First machine placed | Month 1 | $700–800 (bad) to $3K+ (good) | — |
| 2 machines at first location | Month 1–2 | Start small, scale based on performance | Skool guidance |
| 10 machines | ~6–8 months | ~$10K/month | General benchmark |
| 25–30 machines | ~21 months | $35–40K/month | Kyle |
| ~4–6 locations (micro-market) | ~18 months | $30K+/month | Shannon |
| 45 locations, 79 machines | ~24 months | $102K/month | Anthony |
| $42,500/month = ~$500K annual | ~18–24 months | $500K/year | Kyle approaching this |

### When to Hire (And Who)

**1. First Stocker — ASAP after you can't grow**
> "I could no longer do pop-ins and grow the business because I was too busy working IN the business." — Kyle

- **Craigslist** most effective platform — screen for vehicle capacity (fit 6+ bins)
- Word-of-mouth via social media also effective
- **Multiple part-timers > one full-timer** — Kyle learned after his only employee quit on the spot (dropped keys at the door). Now runs 2 part-timers (soon 3)
- "Show up and grind with your team" — best morale boost (Anthony)

**2. Warehouse Manager — At 15–25+ machines**
- Handles kitting, sales analysis, inventory management
- Kyle promoted a driver who preferred computer work
- The other driver just loads and goes — doesn't kit or analyze

**3. Ops Manager — At 40+ locations**
- Handles: ordering inventory, pop-ins, morning dispatch, sales reports, product optimization
- Training period: ~1–1.5 months working together
- Result: Anthony went from 8–10 hours/week to **2 hours/week** (just daily check-ins)

### Hiring Structure (Scaled Route)

```
Owner (you)
├── Ops Manager (ordering, reporting, pop-ins, dispatching)
├── Warehouse Manager (kitting, sales analysis, inventory)
└── Drivers/Stockers ×2-3 (load vehicle, restock, go)
```

### Financing Strategy

**Option 1: 0% APR Business Credit Cards** (Community favorite)
- Chase Ink Cash/Unlimited: $6K spend in 3 months, $900 bonus, 0% APR for 12 months
- Amex Blue Business Plus: $3K spend, lower bonus, easier approval
- **Stagger applications 30–90 days apart** to extend interest-free runway
- Operators funding ~$50K in equipment this way
- Track with spreadsheets + Travel Freely app
- **⚠️ Pay off before promo APR ends** — otherwise 18–25% kicks in

**Option 2: Equipment Financing**
- Monthly payments manageable with machine revenue
- Preserves cash for hiring, inventory, and warehouse

> "I made a mistake liquidating savings to pay cash for machines. I wish I would have financed those first machines and kept that cash for hiring a stocker or reinvesting." — Anthony

**Core principle:** **Finance machines, conserve cash for operations.** Don't give yourself a low-paying job by hoarding cash into machines instead of infrastructure.

### Route Efficiency

- Monitor revenue-to-labor ratios as you scale
- Benchmark: **$3,500 revenue for 8 labor hours + expenses**
- **Move underperforming machines before buying more** — one operator doubled revenue by relocating a micro-market to a different building on the same campus
- Keep service radius to **10–15 miles max** (Shannon's rule)

### Buying Existing Routes

- **Distressed routes:** 0.5×–1× annual revenue
- **Better-run setups:** Up to 2× annual revenue
- PE groups entering the market buying routes >$10M/year — "Supply & demand in an industry going through disruption is great for you guys"

## 8. Mistakes to Avoid

### Location Mistakes

1. **Placing machines for convenience, not traffic** — Anthony's $700/month machine was 5 min from his house. His $4K–5K machines are in properly qualified locations.
2. **Not asking enough qualifying questions** — Don't assume shift sizes (Anthony assumed 75 on 2nd shift, it was 3). Don't skip the free-snacks question. Don't forget to check for nearby convenience stores.
3. **Garden-style clubhouses** — Limited traffic, theft risk. Hard pass.
4. **Overcommitting on equipment before qualifying the location** — Do your homework first.
5. **89-unit property gamble** — One operator got only $97 first week at a "good lobby location" in a small building.
6. **Government contracts with heavy terms** — 15% rev share + insurance = only $700/month.
7. **Placing machines visible from the street** — Invites vandalism (Kyle Davey).
8. **Fitness centers and pool areas** — Consistently underperform. Push for better placement.
9. **Accepting suboptimal placement from property managers** — Push back diplomatically.

### Sales Mistakes

10. **Stopping pop-ins after first location** — "Momentum matters!" (Thomas Rohlader). Never stop prospecting.
11. **Getting discouraged by rejection** — It's a numbers game. 1 in 10 is normal. Results come in waves.
12. **Not using a CRM** — With 10–12 week+ sales cycles, you WILL lose leads without one.
13. **Not asking for referrals** — Every property manager knows other property managers. End every pop-in with: "Do you manage other properties?"
14. **Ignoring competition or letting it intimidate you** — When a competitor sent Kyle a cease-and-desist, he went harder.

### Pricing & Product Mistakes

15. **Underpricing** — Harder to raise prices than to start high. Always start at 3× cost or gas-station parity (Jason Carlin).
16. **Buying variety packs at scale** — Waste from unsold flavors makes effective cost 50+ cents higher per unit. Get distributor relationships for single-SKU ordering ASAP.
17. **Promising "all healthy" product mix** — Products won't move. Top sellers remain energy drinks, candy, and frozen items.
18. **Not registering as reseller** at Costco/Sam's — Paying unnecessary sales tax with no way to claw it back (Thomas Rohlader).

### Operations Mistakes

19. **Trying to do everything yourself too long** — "You can't do $25/hour tasks all the time." Hire before you think you're ready. The opportunity cost of missed pop-ins far exceeds a stocker's wage.
20. **Only having one employee** — When Kyle's only employee quit on the spot, everything fell apart. Always have 2+ part-timers for redundancy.
21. **Two stockers quit via text on stocking day** — Always have backup (Skool community).
22. **Not testing every item before opening** — Scan everything; SKUs change.
23. **Ignoring planogram dimensions** — Tall bottles waste vertical shelf space.
24. **SIM cards for connectivity** — Spotty. Use dedicated routers.
25. **Stockwell temperature lockout** — Machine went into lockout mode after install; no sales until manually fixed. Monitor new installs closely.
26. **Leaving damaged machines in bad neighborhoods** — "Bad guys probably aren't going to stop."

### Financial Mistakes

27. **Paying cash for machines instead of financing** — Conserve cash for operations, hiring, and inventory. Finance the machines — revenue covers payments (Anthony).
28. **Not paying off 0% APR cards before promo ends** — 18–25% interest kicks in.

### Fresh Food Mistakes

29. **Jumping into fresh food without systems** — "Fresh food — I've had a lot of it spoil and go bad. That takes a LOT more management and logistics. Tread carefully!" (Kyle Davey). Minimum $2 profit target on expiring items.

## 9. Kande VendTech Action Plan — Las Vegas

### 🔴 Priority 1: Immediate (This Week)

1. **Score your 91 prospects** against the qualification checklist in Section 3
   - 200+ units for residential, 150+ employees for industrial
   - Proximity to convenience stores
   - 24/7 access
   - Building type (high-rise > garden)
   - Rank them A/B/C

2. **Register as a reseller** at Costco and Sam's Club — stop paying sales tax on COGS immediately

3. **Set up a CRM** — every prospect, every touch, every follow-up date. Non-negotiable with a 10–12 week average sales cycle and 91 leads

4. **Arm your salesperson with the pitch deck:**
   - The $54 rent premium stat
   - "Smart market / AI-powered convenience" language (not "vending")
   - Qualifying questions checklist
   - Distributor advantage talking point (5,000 SKUs)

### 🟡 Priority 2: This Month

5. **Prioritize Class A luxury apartments and medical outpatient facilities** — these are the highest-performing location types. Las Vegas has tons of luxury high-rises and medical complexes

6. **Set pop-in targets:** Minimum 10–15 pop-ins per week. Batch into dedicated days if needed. Your salesperson's time doing pop-ins is the #1 growth lever — protect it

7. **Establish distributor relationships** — get set up with Vistar or a local distributor for single-SKU ordering and rebates. Stop buying variety packs

8. **Build your initial planogram** with real product dimensions and proven top sellers:
   - Core Water, Smartwater, Coke Zero (water/beverages)
   - Monster, Red Bull (energy — highest velocity)
   - Fair Life Core Power 42g protein (premium, high-margin)
   - Cheetos Flamin' Hot, Snickers, Skinny Pop (snacks)
   - Ramen, Pop-Tarts (high-margin staples)
   - At residential: TP, paper towels, Advil, laundry pods

9. **Price everything using the 3× rule** with psychological pricing ($2.49, $3.95, $7.99). Start high. You can always adjust down

### 🟢 Priority 3: First 90 Days

10. **Hire 2 part-time stockers** before you think you need them. Use Craigslist, screen for vehicle capacity (6+ bins). Redundancy from day one

11. **Secure storage/warehouse** — even a storage unit with 24/7 access and receiving capability is a game changer vs. running out of your home

12. **Install dedicated routers** at every location — don't rely on SIM cards

13. **Ask for referrals at every single touchpoint** — property managers know other property managers. One relationship can unlock multiple locations. Target the property management companies, not just individual buildings

14. **Push for mailroom/package-room placement** at every residential location — consistently the top performer

15. **Negotiate revenue share down** — push for $0 or flat $25/month. If they insist on percentage, go tiered/sliding to protect yourself on slow months

### 📊 Targets & Milestones

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Month 1–2 | First 2–3 machines placed in qualified A-locations |
| Month 3–4 | 5–8 machines, first stocker hired, warehouse/storage secured |
| Month 6 | 10+ machines, ~$10K+/month, distributor relationships active |
| Month 12 | 20+ machines, $20K+/month, 2 part-time stockers |
| Month 18 | 30+ machines, $35K+/month, warehouse + warehouse manager |
| Month 24 | 45+ locations, $75K+/month, ops manager hired, you're at 2 hrs/week |

### Las Vegas-Specific Advantages

- **Massive luxury apartment market** — Strip-adjacent high-rises are perfect targets
- **24/7 culture** — residents and tourists are up at all hours, driving vending demand
- **Medical corridor** — Henderson and Summerlin have clusters of outpatient facilities
- **Growing population** — new developments = "get in first" opportunities
- **Hot climate** — beverages (especially water and cold drinks) will be top sellers year-round

## 🌿 Corporate Wellness Program — Selling Guide

### Why Wellness Vending?

Corporate wellness is a **$61B+ market** growing 6–7% annually. Companies are actively seeking ways to promote employee health — and healthy vending is one of the easiest, lowest-friction ways to do it. This is a **premium upsell** that commands higher margins and builds stickier client relationships.

### Key Selling Points

1. **Healthier employees = lower healthcare costs** — Companies spend $15K+/employee/year on health insurance. Even small improvements in employee health habits can reduce claims, absenteeism, and premiums. Position vending as part of their wellness ROI story.

2. **Improved productivity and morale** — Studies show access to healthy food options during work hours increases afternoon productivity by 20%+. Employees who eat well perform better — that's a direct business benefit.

3. **Corporate social responsibility (CSR)** — Many companies need to show ESG/CSR initiatives. A healthy vending program is a visible, easy win they can include in annual reports, recruiting materials, and employee satisfaction surveys.

4. **Employee satisfaction perk** — In the war for talent, perks matter. Subsidized healthy vending is a tangible benefit that employees interact with daily — much more visible than a gym discount they never use.

5. **Customizable healthy options** — We curate product selections based on employee preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals. Offer gluten-free, vegan, low-sugar, high-protein, keto-friendly — whatever fits their workforce.

6. **Nutrition labeling on all products** — Full transparency on every item. Calorie counts, macros, allergen info. Positions us as the premium, health-conscious operator vs. competitors stocking Doritos and Mountain Dew.

### The Wellness Pitch Framework

**Opening:** "Beyond standard vending, we offer a Corporate Wellness Vending Program that aligns with your company's health initiatives..."

**Key talking points:**
- Curated selection of healthy snacks, drinks, and meal options
- Monthly wellness reports showing healthy vs. standard product consumption
- Subsidy options — company pays $X/mo to offset costs, making healthy options cheaper for employees
- Seasonal rotation of products (New Year health kicks, summer hydration, etc.)
- Custom branding/signage promoting company wellness program
- Nutrition education cards and QR codes linking to product info

### Subsidy Model

Many companies will **subsidize healthy options** to incentivize employee wellness:

| Subsidy Level | Monthly Cost | What It Covers |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Basic | $50–100/mo | 10–15% discount on healthy items |
| Standard | $100–250/mo | 20–30% discount on healthy items |
| Premium | $250–500/mo | All healthy items discounted 30%+, monthly wellness reports |
| Full Program | $500+/mo | Custom curation, quarterly wellness events, premium product selection |

**Why subsidies work for us:** Even with the discount, margins on healthy products are often 50–65%. The subsidy creates lock-in (they've budgeted for it), drives volume (cheaper = more sales), and makes us the preferred operator.

### Best Wellness Products (High-Margin, High-Demand)

| Product | COGS | Retail | Margin | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Core Power Protein Shake | ~$3.50 | $7.99 | ~56% | Meal replacement, flies off shelves |
| Kind Bars | ~$0.85 | $2.49 | ~66% | Recognizable healthy brand |
| RXBARs | ~$1.20 | $3.49 | ~66% | Clean label, protein-focused |
| Bai Antioxidant Water | ~$1.00 | $2.99 | ~67% | Low calorie, great taste |
| Core Hydration Water | ~$0.93 | $2.99 | ~69% | Top velocity healthy option |
| Fresh salads | ~$3.00 | $7.65 | ~61% | Premium margins, daily demand |
| Quest Protein Chips | ~$1.50 | $3.99 | ~62% | Keto/low-carb crowd loves these |
| Celsius Energy | ~$1.50 | $3.99 | ~62% | Fitness-focused energy drink |
| Siggi's Yogurt | ~$1.25 | $3.49 | ~64% | High protein, low sugar |
| Fresh fruit cups | ~$1.50 | $3.99 | ~62% | Visual freshness sells |

### Target Companies for Wellness

- **Tech companies** — Health-conscious workforce, generous perks budgets
- **Healthcare facilities** — Walk the talk, employees expect healthy options
- **Financial services** — Long hours, willing to pay for convenience
- **Law firms** — High billing rates = low price sensitivity
- **Corporate headquarters** (200+ employees) — Budget for wellness programs
- **Fitness/wellness companies** — Obviously aligned
- **Insurance companies** — Literally incentivized to promote health

### Tracking Wellness in CRM

Use the 🌿 **Wellness Program** toggle on each prospect card to:
- Flag companies interested in wellness programs
- Track subsidy amounts (monthly budget they've committed)
- Keep wellness-specific notes (dietary preferences, program requirements)
- Filter the CRM to see all wellness-interested prospects at a glance

## 11. January 2026 Office Hours Key Insights

> Extracted from Vendingpreneurs Skool Office Hour Recordings (Jan 2026)

### Equipment Deep Dive: Sandstar vs HaHa vs 365

**From 1.15.2026 Foundations with Kyle Davey:**
- **Ease of setup:** HaHa is more plug-and-play; Sandstar requires more upfront setup but offers stronger long-term flexibility
- **AI & tracking:** Sandstar's AI provides real-time sales visibility; customers initially try to "test" the system
- **Training products:** On-site AI training for new SKUs is required but manageable
- **Payments:** Sandstar supports AMEX; HaHa does not
- **Hardware quality:** Sandstar machines are robust, with minor "growing pains" (missing brackets, shipping logistics)
- **Support:** Sandstar support praised for responsiveness (overnight parts, next-day technician flights)
- **Pricing:** Sandstar is lower cost ($3,700–$5,500 fully tricked out)

### Location Revenue Forecasting

**Revenue estimation framework:**
- Unit count / population size
- Foot traffic observation (people per hour)
- Proximity to elevators, mailrooms, and central corridors
- Match machine cost + SaaS fees to realistic revenue expectations
- Expensive machines with high fees are a poor fit for low-traffic or seasonal locations (e.g., clubhouses)

### Sales: Taking Over from Competitors

**When locations already sell snacks (from 1.15 Foundations):**
1. Offer to take over operations entirely
2. Propose revenue share, flat service fee, or concierge model
3. Explore trade-offs (referrals, other properties)

**For gyms & sports facilities:**
- Identify staffing pain points
- Frame vending as operational relief, not competition

**Recommended script for existing vendor situations:**
1. "What do you like about your current setup?"
2. "What would you change if you could?"
3. "If I fix that problem, would you switch vendors?"

### Pricing Objections at Medical Facilities

**Premium pricing must be justified by value, not technology alone.**

**Angles that resonate with price-sensitive locations:**
- Convenience factor (24/7 access, no leaving building)
- Time savings for busy professionals
- Meal replacement options for long shifts
- Quality and freshness vs. nearby alternatives

### Operations: Cold Chips in Coolers

- Putting ambient items (chips) in coolers is **common but not "normal"** — comfort level matters
- Operators should **decide the machine**, not let locations choose
- Start small when traffic is unknown; upgrade to larger units as demand proves out
- Core selling point: single transaction, multi-item checkout, mimicking a convenience store

### Warehouse & Route Expansion

**From 1.13.2026 Vendhub with Anthony:**
- Moving warehouses is time-consuming but enables growth (e.g., from 692 sq ft → 1,300 sq ft)
- Expanding routes requires careful consideration of capital, credit, and personal bandwidth
- **Strategy:** Trim underperforming parts of the route while leveraging high-performing locations

### Refrigerated/Frozen Delivery Logistics

- Refrigerated/frozen products must be stored promptly; ice or gel packs help maintain temperature
- Van setup: Uses insulated containers and delivery bags, no built-in refrigeration needed
- Operators should confirm handling procedures with distributors/OpCo and document best practices (videos recommended)

### Traditional vs Smart Machines (1.21 Scaling Call)

**From Jason Carlin's Scaling/Operations call:**
- Traditional machines: Low-cost to acquire, high-capacity, mostly hands-off
- Business can grow through acquisition of existing traditional routes
- Exploring modern solutions for A-class properties while keeping traditional machines for volume locations
- Traditional machines still have a place in the portfolio — not everything needs to be smart/AI

## 12. Community Intelligence Update (Feb 2026)

> Updated from Vendingpreneurs Skool community scrape on 2026-02-01

### Hot Topics (Jan-Feb 2026)

**Equipment Decisions:**
- **HAHA vs SandStar** remains the #1 equipment debate (64 comments on single thread). HAHA appears to be winning among experienced operators.
- **MicroMart shipping warning:** Expect 6+ week delivery. Poor customer support (unresponsive to email, chat, phone, WhatsApp). Plan accordingly.
- **Freezers** are an emerging add-on opportunity — operators actively seeking revenue data. Both AI freezers and open market freezers being evaluated.
- **Cantaloupe** can replicate existing micro-market setups from photos — useful when taking over from competitors.

**Pop-In Strategy Evolution:**
- **Gift bags ($5 from Costco)** are now the consensus #1 pop-in strategy. Use transparent bags with handles. "The energy in the room flipped instantly."
- **Competition is intensifying** — one PM reported receiving 10 vending pitches in a single month. Professional proposals are now table-stakes, not a differentiator.
- **Dynamic proposal builders** gaining traction — customize proposals by location type with location-specific language (e.g., "residents" for apartments).
- **The regional PM is the real decision maker** — always give the on-site PM a PDF they can forward up.

**Competitor Intelligence:**
- **Canteen** continues to lose accounts due to poor stocking frequency and no revenue share. Actively being displaced by VP operators.
- When Canteen vacates, they take ALL their equipment. Plan to bring your own.

**Property Management:**
- **Greystar** requires NetVendor certification — get this before approaching Greystar properties.
- **Holland** properties likely have similar vendor approval requirements.
- **Large corporate contracts** (7+ machines) may require 3 client references — a challenge for new operators.

**Location Insights:**
- **Hotels** described as "begging" for vending operators — very underserved market.
- **Police stations** being explored as a location type.
- **Private schools (teachers' lounges)** — viable for 150+ teachers, but address theft concerns and camera placement upfront.
- **Luxury high-rises with existing Coke/Pepsi coolers** — can coexist by stocking complementary products rather than replacing.

**Operations:**
- Solo installations streamlined to **2.5 hours** by Level 8 operator Lea Vrabelova.
- Key installation tools: collapsible crates for drinks/chips, clear containers for candy/snacks (prevent crushing), tool organizers.
- **Theft** is a real concern — community sharing first theft experiences and camera strategies.

  - At $5,300/month: Stripe ≈ $438 vs WeVend ≈ $300 in fees
  - Stripe only competitive at $9+ average ticket

- Cameras pay for themselves by deterring repeat offenders
- Prepaid gift cards from revenue share for property tours (avoids inventory discrepancies)
- Genesis Decor (GenesisDecor.com) for custom market cabinetry
- Vinyl wraps and custom cabinetry integrate machines into location aesthetics

### NEW: Route Acquisition Guidance (Jan 2026)
- **Buy at 50-80% of annualized revenue** — strong caution against 1× revenue
- Apartment complexes = higher acquisition risk due to PM turnover
- Facebook Marketplace increasingly unreliable for route purchases
- Best sources: local machine suppliers, cold-calling aging operators
- Small routes (2-6 locations) don't warrant business multiples
- Many deals reopen after initial rejection when sellers reconsider

### NEW: National Account Insights (Jan 2026)
- Leads distributed based on engagement: calls attended, machines purchased, ordering volume
- Slow response = lose lead to another operator
- Accept less-than-ideal locations initially to build national relationships
- Greystar certification = NetVendor approval (LLC + insurance + documentation)

### NEW: Revenue Diversification Strategy (Jan 2026)
- Stack revenue streams per location: ice machines, massage chairs, claw/gaming machines
- Strategy: increase route value AND eventual resale multiplier
- Workplace accounts: employers prefer markets + employee allowances over free food
- Bundle coffee, water, ice programs to subsidize early market performance

### NEW: Payment Processing Deep Dive (Jan 2026 — Lane Folkers)
- **Stripe (2.9% + $0.30/txn) vs WeVend/Preva (~5.5-5.9%, no per-txn fee)**
- At ~$5,300/mo, ~950 txns: Stripe ≈ $438/mo vs WeVend ≈ $300/mo
- Stripe only competitive at higher avg ticket ($9+) with fewer transactions
- QR-only payments may reduce conversions — many users still prefer physical cards
- **Avoid Cantaloupe:** long onboarding (~30 days), machines sit idle waiting
- WeVend: responsive onboarding, daily weekday payouts, clunky backend

### NEW: Licensing Risk Alert (Jan 2026 — Lane Folkers)
- Some cities charge per-machine/per-location license fees → destroys profitability
- Register as supplier/distributor, NOT operator (mirrors larger vending companies)
- Research how existing vending companies are registered in your city before filing
- Illinois example: vending machine certificate + machine sticker required

### NEW: Clawback Policy Best Practice (Jan 2026 — Charles Wheeler)
- Tiered clawback: start 15% for expensive machines, reduce to 10% for cheaper
- Large installs (~$20K) fully protected at "month zero"
- Frame as standard risk protection, similar to lease clauses
- No first-year cancellations reported when using this approach
- Minimize contract friction except for large capital deployments

### NEW: Staffing KPIs & Systems (Jan 2026 — multiple calls)
- Drivers: ~$20/hour, no rev share unless directly impacting revenue
- Warehouse loading: ≤15-20 minutes per route
- On-site stocking: ≤30 minutes per location
- GPS clock-in/out, same-day pick lists
- Random weekly quality audits for expired products
- Revenue-share pay model: 1% of location revenue as quarterly bonus
- Multi-step hiring: resume → video interview (worst parts of job upfront) → field training
- Background checks required for luxury property access
- Accept 75-80% execution quality to scale — perfection blocks growth

### NEW: Frozen Food Strategy (Jan 2026 — Anthony/VenHub)
- **Freezer-first strategy:** frozen microwavable meals > fresh food for most operators
- Fresh food: ~70% spoilage historically across apartments, offices, medical
- Frozen partner example: ships frozen, 6 months shelf life, 10-14 days once thawed
- Operator responsible for labeling expiration dates
- Freezers outperform low-performing ambient or redundant coolers
- Insulated boxes (Cambro) essential for transporting temperature-sensitive products

### NEW: College Location Strategy (Jan 2026 — Lane Folkers)
- Coke exclusivity common → food-forward offerings (wraps, Hillshire trays, snacks)
- Monthly minimums + profit-based incentives (15% after minimum) > traditional rev share
- Account for seasonality: summer breaks drastically reduce traffic
- Sandstar preferred for college: lower entry cost, AI tracking, AMEX support

### NEW: Operator-as-Expert Sales Philosophy (Jan 2026 — Charles Wheeler)
- **Never let locations choose machines from brochures — prescribe the solution**
- Default approach: start with smaller Stockwell when traffic uncertain
- If restocking exceeds 2x/week → upgrade to larger Pico Vision
- Core selling point: single transaction, multi-item checkout (convenience store feel)
- Coil machines avoided — slower, single-item, inferior brand positioning
- Market-style setups outperform coils for brand positioning and transaction efficiency

### NEW: Pop-In Advanced Tactics (Jan 2026 — Mallorie Rauch, Matt Morrison)
- **Tiered rev share for pop-in negotiations:** 3% ($800-1,600) / 5% ($1,600-2,500) / 7% ($2,500-4,000) / 10% ($4,000+)
- Rev share offered only if requested, except for large property groups
- Proposals include: machine selection, features, product mix, rev share, next steps — one page
- Delivery timelines and regulatory approval communicated upfront
- Mockups outsourced to graphic designers ($20-40 per mockup, ~24hr turnaround)
- **Digital business cards (Dot Card):** strong ROI, QR codes, recommended over websites early on
- Carrd landing pages as website alternative — simple, low-cost
- Apollo: free multi-step email sequences for low-touch outreach
- Physical visits > emails for warm leads; emails mainly for proposals and documentation

### NEW: Sales Tax Compliance (Jan 2026 — Antares Vargas)
- State-specific rules: monthly, quarterly, or annual filings based on volume
- Multi-state (e.g., Kansas City KS/MO): separate reporting per state
- MicroMart: no separate line-item tax → bake into pricing
- HaHa: allows separate line-item collection
- Example: $10,000 sales × 4.075% = $407.50 owed to state
- County & city taxes combined; use Department of Revenue lookup tools

### NEW: Key Financial Benchmarks (Jan 2026 — consolidated)
- **$1,200/month is SALES, not profit** — revenue first covers machine financing, inventory, connectivity
- Approaching $500K annual sales with margins fluctuating 15-22% (operator example)
- $4,000-$4,500/month in machine financing = major margin drag
- Paying off machines improves margins by ~10-15%
- Realistic net margins: ~40-50% after fees, before labor
- Target 12-month machine payback including fees and restrictions

- Frame as tenant/patient amenity, not revenue share
- Top movers: Quest chips, Barebells bars, Gatorade, prebiotic sodas
- Bulk resale of drinks/coffee/K-cups to facility admin adds margin

### NEW Sales Tactics
- "Magic wand" question → firm evaluation period (14-30 days) → conditional switch commitment
- Create urgency with equipment lead times and ready inventory

- National Lead MSA check-ins: Tue/Wed/Thu 12:30-12:45 PM CT

### NEW Insurance (Hub International - Aug 2025)
- GL ≠ machine coverage; use Inland Marine (transit) or Scheduled Property (fixed)

## NEW INSIGHTS — January 2026 (from 6 video-only transcriptions)

### VP Machine Platform (Coming 2026)
- Minus 40 hardware + VP's own proprietary software (built from ground up)
- Expected to integrate with VenHub ecosystem; likely community-standard pricing
- No launch date yet — but Mike/VP team doing things right (consensus from ambassadors)
- AI detection + own backend = potential best-of-both-worlds platform

### Freezers as Growth Category
- All major platforms releasing AI freezers in H1 2026 (HaHa, 365, MicroMart Q1, SandStar Q2)
- **Vistar Freezer Planogram Calculator**: Excel tool that calculates margin velocity per freezer
- Ice cream at eye level (highest impulse margin), big items bottom shelf
- **Nestle/Mars incentive**: 6 Nestle + 4 Mars items across up to 5 freezers = free cases or pushers
- Minus 40 freezers = gold standard (dual-temp option available)

### USG Rebate Mastery
- **Anthony's Frito-Lay math**: 11% base + 0.5% data + 1.5% innovation = up to 13% rebate
- Net effective cost per unit often 7-10% below VenMarket list price
- Make first VenMarket order ASAP (even $20 personal purchase) → triggers USG enrollment queue
- Linda from USG will audit and nudge operators 1-2 cases from qualifying — don't rely on it though
- Quarterly cutoff dates are firm — missing by one day = wait 3 more months

### Bigger Bags = More Profit (Anthony's Key Insight)
- 1oz chips from Sam's: sell $1.25 → $0.87 profit
- 1.75oz chips from VenMarket: sell $2.99 → **$2.24 profit** (2.5x more)
- Smart machine space is limited → maximize profit per facing, not margin percentage
- "Sacrifice margin for profit every single day"

### VenHub Off-Platform Orders (Jan 2026)
- System auto-detects Vistar orders made directly with AEs (outside VenHub)
- Invoices automatically received and shown in VenHub orders list
- Reduces email friction between operators and AEs

### PrintWithMe Coffee Partnership
- 11-year-old amenity company — leader in multifamily coffee & printing
- Caffection Cymbal machine: 12 drinks, resident allowances, fixed-cost for PMs
- Can reduce property coffee spend by 60%
- **VP operators can cross-sell during pop-ins** — same decision-makers

### Pop-In Language & Objection Handling (Charles Wheeler)
- Never say "vending" or "contract" — use "smart market" and "service agreement"
- Seasonal gift baskets beat Amazon gift cards (shows product quality, memorable)
- $250 PM referral fee creates ongoing sister-property pipeline
- "You ain't seen vending machines hold Tide pods and body wash"
- Practice at low-stakes locations first → refine script → target ideal properties

### Garden-Style Apartments — Not Always Bad
- Lane's garden-style micro market: $1K-1.2K/month with fob-controlled access
- Another operator: 100-unit building doing **$3K/month** (college students in building)
- Key variables: centralized amenities, fob access, demographic mix (students boost)

### Inventory Lean Operations (Antares Vargas)
- Intentionally run low → force fresh product cycling → minimal spoilage
- Organize warehouse alphabetically matching software report format
- Highest spoilage: chips & pastries → monitor carefully, rotate between machines
- Physical checks > software-only tracking (worth $40/biweekly)

### Year-End Tax Reality
- Must count ALL inventory (warehouse + every machine) as assets for tax purposes
- Many operators don't learn this until first CPA conversation — plan ahead
- Sales tax: state relies on your reported numbers — accuracy matters

### Insurance Consolidation
- **Hartford**: most competitive bundled GL + work comp (~$1,200-1,500/year)
- Some communities require work comp specifically for stockers entering property
- Add commercial vehicle to personal auto policy to meet requirements

## Insights from Loom Transcript Extraction (Feb 2026)
> 60 recordings transcribed from Loom Whisper (6 × 2026 Office Hours + 54 × 2025 Weekly Calls)
> Total corpus: ~3.7 MB raw transcript text covering May 2025 – Jan 2026

### Machine Security — Real-World Case Study
- Apartment lobby machine physically moved via elevator to 3rd floor and broken into (Jul 2025)
- Credit card reader ripped off, major damage
- **Full insurance claim approved** — reinforces need for proper Inland Marine + Scheduled Property coverage
- Machine was doing $1,500+/month — high revenue attracts theft risk
- Property management took blame ("black eye") — use as leverage for better security clauses
- **Prevention**: Bolt to floor, require camera coverage in contract, prefer locations with 24-hr concierge

### University Market Entry Strategy
- Universities often have existing food service contracts (Aramark, Sodexo, franchise cafeterias)
- Don't compete head-on with established food programs
- **Niche strategy**: Target dorms with incidentals, snacks, OTC meds, laundry supplies
- Band camps, athletic facilities, and summer programs have separate procurement from main food service
- Go through student housing directors, not food service directors

### Gym & Fitness Chain Opportunities
- Major chains (Barry's, Orange Theory, Planet Fitness) typically have branded food/drink programs
- **Best targets**: Independent gyms and CrossFit boxes
- CrossFit: Supplements and pre-workout being stolen from shelves → vending solves theft problem
- Some franchise owners want to outsource machine management but keep revenue split
- Planet Fitness has branded vending machines (custom aesthetic)
- Consider national campaign pitches for branded machines at chain locations

### NAMA Trade Show ROI (May 2025)
- Operators describe it as "brain exploding" for industry connections
- Free product samples to test before committing to orders
- AVS smart coolers and machine organizers notable discovery
- Worth attending even last-minute — networking and brand partnerships alone justify cost
- Key for discovering new product lines and equipment innovations

### Collaboration Call Insights (Pre-Aug 2025 Format)
- Earlier calls used "Collaboration Call" format — more open Q&A, less structured than later Weekly Calls
- Operators freely share revenue numbers, challenges, and strategies
- Cross-industry backgrounds common: agriculture, insulation, real estate, carpet cleaning
- Community cohesion strongest in these smaller, candid sessions
- MicroMart Group Training sessions provide deep technical instruction on machine setup and software

### Transcript Extraction Method (Reusable)
- Loom embeds contain Apollo state with signed transcript URLs
- Transcript format: JSON with timestamped phrases (Whisper-generated)
- URLs expire but can be re-extracted from embed pages
- Skool course data accessible via Next.js __NEXT_DATA__ with auth cookies
- 63 of 118 Skool recordings had Loom embeds; 55 pre-Loom recordings had no video links
- 9 older Loom videos returned 404 (expired/deleted)

## 2026-02-04: Fitness Centers CAN Work (Vendingpreneurs Video)

**Source:** "How He Replaced His W2 With Just 2 Vending Locations" (Feb 3, 2026)

**Key Learning:** The "avoid gyms" rule has exceptions. Andy's 2 fitness center locations do $10K/month topline.

**What makes fitness centers work:**
- 7-day per week operation (not just weekday mornings)
- High foot traffic throughout the day
- Right demographics (members who buy on impulse)
- Owner transparency with existing data

**What to look for:**
- Ask about daily/weekly member visits
- Check if it's a 24/7 or extended hours facility
- Look for family-oriented gyms vs pure bodybuilding
- Consider fitness centers with pools, classes, amenities (more dwell time)

**Still avoid:**
- Hardcore bodybuilding gyms (macro counters, meal preppers)
- Small boutique studios with short class times
- Planet Fitness-type with very low membership fees (cost-conscious members)

**Action:** Update lead criteria to distinguish "good" vs "bad" fitness locations.

## 2026-02-05 — New Insights from Vendingpreneurs

### Source: "How He Replaced His W2 With Just 2 Vending Locations" (Feb 3, 2026)
- **Andy Kunselman:** 2 fitness center locations = $10K/month topline (4 machines)
- Joined Vendingpreneurs Aug 2025 → First install Dec 2025 (4 months)

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Fitness centers** can be unicorn locations (7-day/week operation = consistent traffic)
2. **Do the napkin math** — Partner analyzed demographics + foot traffic before committing
3. **Get existing data** — Business owner shared their current vending numbers
4. **45-day learning period** before going full-time is reasonable
5. **"The energy you put in is the energy you get out"**
6. **Goal setting:** 4 machines → 20 machines in 12 months is achievable

### Location Intel:
- High-volume fitness centers doing $5K/machine/month
- If business owner already has vending but doing it poorly = opportunity to take over
- Ask property managers for existing revenue data when possible
